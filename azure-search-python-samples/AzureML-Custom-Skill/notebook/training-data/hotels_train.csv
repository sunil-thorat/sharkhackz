The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast. Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there."
1,Great outage base for city break. Quiet neighborhood
2,"Quiet, friendly staff, no issues"
3,"Excellent service, beautiful Christmas decor, wonderful time at the Trellis Spa"
4,Met up with our daughter and had a great time in Houston. The hotel was easy to find and was quite lovely--especially the spa!! Would highly recommend taking time to use the Trellis Spa while in Houston.
5,Everyone at the hotel made our stay so amazing. We were there in time to see the harvest decorations being put away and the magnificent Christmas decor being put up. They all did an amazing job. It is definitely more for couples and grown ups. It would feel too stuffy for children
6,We have been staying at the Houstonian hotel for 20 years now and it's never let us down!!! When the staff calls us by our names year after year.... What does that tell u about the hotel management
7,Hotel was awesome. Service was beyond anything I've gotten before. Room service and food was EXCELLENT.
8,Great place to enjoy relaxing family time. 3 pools! Several restaurants and very friendly staff.
9,"Hotel and hotel staff are amazing, 5 stars. Family pool was awful, our neighborhood pool is 100x's cleaner, better service personnel and life guards that enjoy their job. Great get away for couples or business, leave family at home."
10,"25th anniv mini getaway. Secluded yet in the Uptown area, great, restrained service."
11,Loved the Houstonian!
12,"Walls extremely thin, you can hear everything. Excessive hoovering every morning outside bedroom. There. Is a bar, but no one to tend it."
13,We loved it!
14,"We live on the other side of Houston and felt that our stay at the Houstonian was a wonderful getaway. It really felt like we were on holiday. We loved the comfort, the view of the woods and the tranquility of the place."
15,"Very comfortble, traditional, and family oriented"
16,"Great stay as always. Superior accommodations, food, fitness classes(31/day)with excellent instructors, grounds, swimming pools. The best in Houston by far."
17,The most relaxing beautiful hotel in Houston. Service is exceptional and staff is excellent. Spa is the best inTexas....
18,"The hotel was nice but is very outdated. The bathroom for a family for very, very small. We had a deluxe king room which is good for 4 people but the bathroom was the size fit for a standard room for 2 people."
19,Return guest. Accommodation was great as usual.
20,Wonderful stay! Great couples retreat. Make sure you stay a couple of days to take advantage of all of the amenities including the Trellis Spa. Will definitely be back for our anniversary. Staff is superb and don't forget to eat at the restaurant downstairs Olivette.
21,"The Houstonian may not be the cheapest hotel in the area, but I believe it's the best. It's still a great value when you look at the service, amenities, and location. The grounds make it a wonderful oasis in a busy part of the city. Everything is kept up immaculately and is first class. The rooms have everything you could need for a comfortable stay. I loved walking the beautiful and easy to walk path around the grounds each morning and seeing/hearing all the birds. I didn't use the pool areas, but they are gorgeous and spacious. Highly recommended hotel."
22,"We always have a pleasant stay at the Houstonian, love the atmosphere, the rooms are also dark in the morning due to the lush greenery so we are able to get a good nights rest. We were celebrating our triplet grandchildren's 6th Birthday (their favorite hotel) and they were surprised by the hotel with a plate of fresh cookies and milk! Thank you Houstonian!"
23,"If you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended."
24,"I checked in for 10 days, but checked out after 2. My problem with the hotel was room size - particularly bathroom size. The bedroom was adequate. The bathroom ceiling is at about 6.5 feet. The door opens into the tiny bathroom which makes it necessary to close the door making it extremely claustrophobic."
25,The king size bed was the most uncomfortable bed I had slept in for decades. I honestly thought I was sleeping on a sheet of plywood.
26,"This hotel is way over rated, it's nothing like the description or the reviews. Basically its Old (very old) building in the heart of apartment complex/parking lot jungle. Furniture is very old, hotel theme feel like 1850s, clean but old. Tge staff is friendly but you can tell they inexperienced , mostly in there 20s. Room it self spacious but old, old carpet and TV. Bathrooms similar to Motels, bedsheets clean, new sheets, but bed is saggy. Surrounding area is jungle, literally!! Misty and not well kept. Lots traffic once you leave parking. Ppl come from surrounding complex apartments to run on trail. Bottom line, money wasted, will never come again."
27,Staff were awesome. By 2 nd day knew our name and were so nice. Will definitely go there again.
28,"Nice hotel, secluded so that you don't feel like you're in the city but convenient for business great exercise facilities for working out. swimming and tennis."
29,"Great resort facilities, several pools, including a lap pool and an enormous gym. Room was very comfortable. We went for the concierge package, which included complementary drinks, snacks and continental breakfast. Lovely."
30,Fantastic hotel.
31,"We stop at the Houstonian every year on our way to ski and my 2 teenage boys just love it. We love the location, the food and the workout facilities. My kids especially love the basketball court!"
32,Hotel is very nice. High end finishes. Friendly staff. Bed was comfortable. There was some noise both from other guests and maintenance of grounds. Amenities are exceptional. Food in restaurants was also very good.
33,"Rooms and bathrooms are a little bit outdated, pool and spa is great!"
34,"Hotel facilities are good and breakfast ample. Econmy rooms have sloping roof so tall guests mind your head We stayed in one and it was fine, the occational bump but for the price you cant really complain."
35,"So relaxing and nice atmosphere. I took my pregnant girlfriend here as a last minute getaway in our hometown before her 3rd child arrived... we relaxed, rested, and enjoy the quite. The spa serices near by were on point..."
36,Room and bathroom were extremely small considering the amount we paid per night to stay.
37,"We have stayed at the Houstonian before and it's always top notch. Their holiday decor is amazing, and the staff is always so helpful."
38,We were in Houston for a family event so several families were staying at the Houstonian. We took advantage of the bar for nightcaps and the large fireplace and comfy sitting area off the lobby for complimentary coffee and conversation.
39,Great hotel! The pools were amazing. We will be staying here anytime we go to Houston
40,Wonderful stay with my boyfriend
41,"Been staying there for 25 years. Great food, great gym, grounds amazing, staff super. Enough said!"
42,5 star accommodations as well as service. Even during the floods- they had staff to help us. We LOVED our time there
43,Combination business and family. Really liked the exercise facility and service all around.
44,Good hotel.
45,Friendly reception very helpful. Hotel has pleasant views and is about ten minute walk to main water bus terminal to take you any direction. We used the spa one day. Good saunas but relaxation area noisy and small. Some lovely restaurants close by and cheaper than in Venice.
46,"My husband and I took a stacation here and it indeed is a five star from the amazing service to all the updated amenities, pools, gym everything was almost perfect. We chose this hotel after I verified that their shuttle went within 3 miles also viewing this on their website. Well time to take off and there was ' no shuttle ' available on Sunday after 6pm which I could not verify. That put a twist on things, we drove around the corner anyhow."
47,"We stayed a couple of nights for our daughter's bday and Father's day weekend for me as well. Everything was topnotch! From the courteous staff and great service down to every little detail. Our rooms were clean and well kept as well as all the public spaces. Our room had a nice view that seemed like we were in the woods. Indoor basketball and tennis court as well outdoor tennis courts just to name a few. Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it. Over all, It's a magnificent place to stay with so many things to enjoy while you're at it. And as my title says, It's a Country Club with a little touch of Hotel!"
48,"We stayed at The Houstonian to celebrate our 17th Wedding Anniversary and are so glad we chose this hotel. There were a few hiccups in our stay, but we had such a nice time that the things that did go wrong are forgiven. The staff did try their best to makeup for the mishaps, which shows that they do care about their guests. I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest. As other reviewers mentioned, the valet service was really top notch and on their game. We will definitely be returning for a staycation at The Houstonian again. Thank you for making it a memorable Anniversary!"
49,We came in for wedding. The staff was exceptional. Loved the workout facility. Will definitely stay again next time we are in Houston.
50,"The Hotel and its grounds are beautiful, to say the least. Very warm, very welcoming, very grand. The staff were incredibly professional and welcoming as well. Everyone from the front desk to the spa to the bar - same level of amazing service. Speaking of the spa - I have never had a spa experience like this. Unbelievable! The ultimate in luxury in relaxation. Due to the flooding in the area we left a night early, just to be on the safe side. They did not charge us the extra night. I am seriously looking for excuses to stay at this hotel again."
51,"What a fabulous hotel and resort property . Incredible amenities made our family time relaxing and enjoyable, providing us with the perfect getaway escape and memories !!"
52,"This is a beautiful hotel with great views and excellent amenities. The Spa staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel front desk staff are not as friendly, yet they are professional. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a luxurious weekend getaway."
53,"The valets here are awesome. They greet you with a smile and a sense of urgency to help. They provide cold bottles of water each time you leave. While it may look like this hotel is off the beaten path, I assure you that it is easy to get to and really gets you out of the fray of the Galleria traffic without leaving the neighborhood."
54,We had a great time there- beautiful place with wonderful staff. Would love to go again
55,"The hotel room was a lotttt smaller than I thought it would be. We ordered room service and there was a hair in the crab cake! Then it took an hour for us to get any kind of manager or staff member to actually help us. Once we finally talked to someone that could help, Kevin, he was extremely short and unpleasant. When we came down for dinner at the restaurant he didn't address us but talked to every other table around us. Hotel was nice, amenities even nicer but I was disappointed at the services especially given how expensive everything is!"
56,It was a bit far from city center
57,Excellent hotel - service was beyond anything we have experienced. I would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a place to stay in Houston. Location is tremendous and the surrounding area is beautiful!
58,"Beautiful hotel, but very intimidating!! Hard to figure out where the pools were."
59,"My wife and I stayed at the Houstonian for 3 nights in October. The property was lovely and the room was very comfortable. However the fitness facilities are truly amazing. The property is connected to the Houstonian Club which is a separate sports club that has truly world class facilities. It has 3 pools (a massive lap pool, resort pool and other small quiet pool), the largest gym I have seen anywhere, basketball and tennis courts, a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes. My wife has been a regular (5 times a week) gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced. She went to 3 classes and the studios, instructors and equipment could not have been better. Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate. In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee, tea, ice tea, water etc... We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent. My wife also visited the spa and although it was expensive the facilities and service were again of the highest quality."
60,"We can to town for a college football game and we a little nervous about the room size some complained about, but found it acceptable. The property is beautiful and the staff was a friendly and helpful as it gets. We will stay here again when we retuen to Houston."
61,"It was like a resort in the middle of Houston. The spa, fitness center and pools were a nice touch that enabled us to stay here and be entertained at the same time. Very nice!"
62,Family weekend Food was great Grandchildren used pool Family used health Club
63,Hotel and facilities are beautiful but room was very musty/ mildewy smelling.
64,"Beautiful hotel at a great value! Amazed at what we paid for a room on the concierge floor that included free daily continental breakfast, early evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, and after dinner dessert buffet. The Olivette restaurant was spectacular - had dinner there both nights. Will definitely be my go-to hotel any time I'm in Houston!"
65,"My family and I like to vist spokane we went on priceline and found that this was the cheapest and it had a indoor pool and and gym We were very pleased the room is clean, smells clean with friendly people and pet friendly. If ur looking for a good night with comfy beds at a good price stay here!"
66,"Budget hotel offers standard amenities and low rates to road-weary travelers. In ShortSince 1946, this Phoenix, Ariz.-based hotel chain has provided guests with comfortable accommodations. Its BestRequests program offers 16 of the most frequently requested services and amenities, including complimentary in-room tea/coffeemakers, hair dryers, iron and ironing boards, free local calls less than 30 minutes and long-distance access. Complimentary toiletries, like toothpaste, razors and sewing kits, are also available upon request. Business travelers will enjoy the computer data ports in each room and photocopying services."
67,"Great hotel, staff where amazing and the location and views make this a great Base to visit Venice!"
68,"I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didn't seem like other people were smoking, so that's good. You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
69,"I always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison, Me. Always very pleasant and cordial staff."
70,Adequate but nothing to recommend it.
71,"We stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter's camp. It was easy to reach, easy to find and perfect for a short stay. The pool is very large, but almost too warm, and the hot tub is uninviting. We'd just come from a Hilton Garden Inn, which is a very good step up, so a comparison to the Waterville Grand Hotel is a bit loaded. We stayed at the Comfort Inn last year, and I'll just say we were determined NOT to stay there again. I'd go back to the Best Western, but I'd suggest you drop the ""grand"" from the name."
72,"Great service, comfortable hotel. Rug was wet in our room by the window. Otherwise, a super hotel - and a great breakfast!"
73,"Great service, comfortable hotel. Rug was wet in our room by the window. Otherwise, a super hotel - and a great breakfast!"
74,excellent place to stay and food was super... great breakfast and friendly staff
75,"The room is comfortable, clean, spacious bathroom and adequate amenities"
76,"Visiting for the night, great breakfast"
77,"We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a $14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!"
78,"Close to Venice and decent hotel, breakfast was okay with no too much selection but has everything you need."
79,"If you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs cold cereal, juice. We didn't use the pool, no time for that."
80,The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.
81,I am a 75yr old Disabled Vet and had requested 2 bed room on first floor as I have walking disability from service. First thing get sent to 2nd floor King. Nobody even read reservation. Finally got a room in the Zoo section where doors had beware of cat signs posted on doors and hall stunk of cat urine. Did... More
82,"I always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison, Me. Always very pleasant and cordial staff."
83,"Hotel was very clean and staff very nice. Beds are only double instead of Queen which makes traveling with two teenage boys not easy. Ordered a cot but really no room to set up had to block bathroom. Great for a two person stay, also free breakfast was for only two people, so had to pay for kids."
84,"This is my second stay recently. Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast....... you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food....... or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy. Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel....... they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it. I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again."
85,"The room was very clean. The staff was very friendly, polite, helpufl and professional."
86,great time and the breakfast was extra good the rest. in the hotel was also very good
87,great time and the breakfast was extra good the rest. in the hotel was also very good
88,"Didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot are left unlocked. I know, I know, we are in Maine... but still. Clean and well equipped... only complaint was lack of outlets for charging. Very inaccessible. Perfect for a quick stay. Very pleasant desk clerk :)"
89,"beautiful views of Venice in the lovely relaxed calmer area of Lido Di Venezia. Gorgeous sunsets and very easy to access Venice, rather than satying in the hustle and bustle. Close to only beaches in Venice. Staff were so helpful, especially Ivan and the lady we met on the desk each morning."
90,"Didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot are left unlocked. I know, I know, we are in Maine... but still. Clean and well equipped... only complaint was lack of outlets for charging. Very inaccessible. Perfect for a quick stay. Very pleasant desk clerk :)"
91,"They should clean the rugs around the elevators, The room was very clean"
92,Free breakfast was great dinner not so much. I don't know why I thought sweet potato encrusted haddock sounded good. They also buried it in a white gravy. Gravy does not belong on fish.
93,"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area."
94,"The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog. However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the 'included breakfast', which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I've encountered in a while."
95,"It's a decent hotel for the price. They provide a solid breakfast, and the rooms are really nice. The only problem is their wifi is spotty if you're in the back of the building."
96,It was an overnighter to get away from some stuff
97,Stayed overnight for pleasure. Room was clean and well equipped. Pool was great.
98,"Ok overall - we stayed one night with our dogs. We were limited in our choices because of this. Hotel could use updating. Was a little bit noisy in the halls, but overall ok. Did not eat on site but at Governor's across the street."
99,"I just ran up to the middle of Maine for a one day business trip. All the people that I had interacted with were very nice, from the people at the hotel to the business staff and owner, and all the people at the various restaurants we ate at. This hotel is dog friendly which was the main reason for... More"
100,This is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.
101,"Rooms have been updated and are very nice.  Pool was a huge hit with our grandchildren but  needs an ""intensive"" cleaning.  They host birthday parties and it would be good if they posted times because it gets way too crazy to enjoy when that many kids are there."
102,"It was very good, but the closet area was not even wide enough for the coat hangers, could not open and shut doors with hangers hanging up"
103,"A good value. Remodeling, room was very comfortable. Lots of food and shopping available within walking distance. Good option for children, has pool."
104,Good value
105,I only booked this hotel because it was dog friendly
106,"We booked a one night stay at the Best Western on a trip to Maine. The was located right at the exit off Route 95. The check inn staff were pleasant and informative. Our room was large, clean and comfortable. It included a refrigerator and microwave as well as a small coffee brewer with the fixings. Our room charge also... More"
107,"We did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of dogs, including a yappy one right next to us. But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room. The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to wait."
108,Great place
109,Room was not clean. We didn't feel comfortable. Cigarette burns in comforter.
110,Room was not clean. We didn't feel comfortable. Cigarette burns in comforter.
111,"We stayed here for four nights in October. The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Assisted in booking tickets for the opera. The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast. Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there."
112,"Nice staff. Nice location. We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice. This is a good balance. Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too, it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita. We didn't see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free. The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy. Internet was free for 20 minutes/day but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice. So in short a good pick, good value for money."
113,"The hotel was comfortable.  It appeared to be popular with workers and truckers.  Families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool, which I did not use.  The restaurant appeared to be a place where contractors went."
114,Stayed overnight for pleasure. Room was clean and well equipped. Pool was great.
115,"While I wouldn't choose the spot for a long term stay, it's location was perfect for an on-the-way hotel, right on the Interstate. Loved the massive room and comfortable bed."
116,1. The door to the room was broken and did not shut properly.2. WiFi frequently stopped working and the staff would not help and told us that we had to work it out with the IT tech from some other company. I would expect the hotel to take care of this.3. We payed for 3 people but they said they would only provide breakfast for 2. I had an unpleasant haggle with the management to finally work this out
117,"Rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff was very peasant, great stay for the price. Had dinner one night in the restaurant which wasn't very good but there are some local pubs in the area which were very good. Breakfast in the restaurant was good. Overall the stay was a good value. Dear williamtO4368AZ - Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel! We're glad you enjoyed your stay, and we will be sure to pass your comments along to the staff at O'Brien's Restaurant :) We hope you'll stay with us again on our next trip to the Waterville area!"
118,There was someone else's stuff left in our washroom.  The person at the counter was snotty when she saw that I had reserved online.
119,"Fast friendly service by all staff.  Could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable, pool area was a little tired with age but functional."
120,It ws just an over night but very good accommodations
121,"The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and facility was spotless. The restaurant was terrible. I made the mistake of ordering one of the specials, prime rib. It was without a doubt the worst prime rib I have ever eaten or should I say tried to eat. Our server asked how it was so I told... More"
122,"Clean room, comfortable beds, lots of pillows. My only complaint is the continental breakfast. Cold cereal, coffee, tea, OJ, toast and muffins. No fresh fruit or yogurt. They offer a full menu, but you pay for it."
123,"We were in Venice for the first time and would always book this hotel located on Lido. Friendly service, right on the canal with great views and relaxed parking."
124,"Clean room, comfortable beds, lots of pillows. My only complaint is the continental breakfast. Cold cereal, coffee, tea, OJ, toast and muffins. No fresh fruit or yogurt. They offer a full menu, but you pay for it."
125,The staff was fantastic. Nice room. Could have used more than 2 bath towels. It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter. I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim. It was a good stay and I would stay there again.
126,"i had a great time nice hotel, friendly staff and clean room"
127,Hotel Great Staff Very friendly and helpful. Room very clean overall A rating
128,very nice!
129,My girlfriend and I visited Waterville Maine for my birthday and to see some of my family. Was one of the most relaxing vacations I've been on. This hotel is great with a relaxing hot tub and spacious rooms. Don't forget the great Ice cream next door at friendlys. I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends looking for a cheap getaway.
130,"Slightly tired hotel, but probably the best hotel in Waterville. Skip the in-house breakfast voucher & eat at Governors or Starbucks across the street."
131,"Slightly tired hotel, but probably the best hotel in Waterville. Skip the in-house breakfast voucher & eat at Governors or Starbucks across the street."
132,"The hotel has come of age and has hardly been renewed. The location is suitable for car travellers as a stage stop, because it is located directly on the motorway. It was pleasant that there was no typical American buffet, but was served at the table. When booking, there was a loan of 7 USD per person, which was sufficient for a simple fr."
133,"Arrived late (10:00 pm). Called ahead to give heads up of late arrival. When we arrived to check in, no one was at front desk. No sign. No human being. Nothing. Waited 15 minutes. Finally front desk person returned. Apologized. Said she had to change someone's sheets. Gross! Hotel was worn/shabby. Only plus was breakfast (included). Table service. Service was good. Food was good."
134,Nice and clean. Rooms are spacious with air conditioning. Good selection of breakfast. Within easy reach of San Marco. Quite location.
135,Great stay. friendly front desk staff. Breakfast in the restaurant was great but dinner was blah. Only issue with the room was the dust pilled up on the shelf where the towels are kept in the bathroom. Other then that I would stay here again.
136,"Need more staff in restraunt on busy weekend. Sat. morning breakfast a disaster. Long wait, wrong order. Otherwise a very good stay. And much better than in past years."
137,"I've been in worse hotels, but not in a long time."
138,"It feels unfair to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under renovations. However, I was extremely disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations. I was happy to see a brand new bed in our room, and the bathroom looked very nice. Until you pulled back the shower curtain. The same old bathtub. Very friendly staff, VERY convenient location. The kitchen lost our room service order, but did take six dollars off the bill. So I would recommend this hotel to others, but I would tell them to wait a while until they get the renos done and sort out a few issues."
139,Hotel smelled musty and had to move rooms water in shower would not turn off did not fell or smell clear either room would not stay again
140,"This hotel was being remodled and should not have been renting rooms on the second floor where we were assigned,it was a total shambles including large holes in the curtains and debris laying everywhere. How could they expect anyone to stay in that kind of environment. We looked at the room and left and rented another hotel, we had already signed in and were werelocked into the contrac with our prebooking through expedia. We are disappointed with expedia on this one."
141,"The hotel was fine, just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors. O'Brien's was a nice surprise, good food and great service. Also, a true breakfast is included with the price of the room, cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet. The internet speed was good as well."
142,One night layover. Hotel was good for that but wouldn't want to stay more than that
143,"The hotel itself was quiet, and the location was easy to find but could use some updates.  I went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken.  The room was also beside the pool making it very humid and uncomfortable.  The shower located in my room leaked all over the bathroom floor."
144,"The inside of the Hotel is old and it smells. The elevators had a n harsh smell of oil. When I reserved my room through Hotels.com it mentioned ""Free Breakfast"" - what a joke. It's a voucher (1 person is allowed $7 off a breakfast of the menu, and $14 total off for 2 or more people at the restaurant. It's really false publicity! I will not be staying at that hotel again. Bathroom in the room was not cleaned. Mirrors were dirty. It's like the rooms were done in a hurry! Roll away bed was pushed in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket. The reservation was for 3. Just a set of 2 towels. We had the heat full blast, and we froze in the middle of the night. Very poor managed!"

146,"traveling with just myself and 2 small kids and the staff was helpful and kind,the food in the rest. was great and affordable."
147,"the hotel was great , clean etc. but that one desk lady was like not to helpful - and the business center is a desk next to the hotel desk and the computer didn't have Microsoft installed and that one desk lady is totally computer unaware and could not do anything to help with the business center malfunctions - except to say. yes, those computers didn't work right and that she knew you couldn't open any attachments and that staples was across the street."
148,"nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased."
149,Lovely stay Lucky with the weather sï¿1/2ï¿1/2 we could sit outside and have dinner
150,Very nice room.loved the pool. Could have been lower in price but would stay there again.
151,Checked in unexepectedly at the last minute. Never spent enough time at the hotel to make any other fair comments. Everything was perfect for what we needed.
152,"OK hotell i utkanten av Waterville. Ganska lugnt age. Hotellet har pool, restaurang och bar och"
153,"No coffee in lobby, front desk suggested I but some at the hotel restaurant. Parking lot was icy and not plowed, even after several complaints. Did not comply with Platinum Status rules. Reservations didn't match room location. Front desk staff was not knowledgeable. Room was nice."
154,"All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in. The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean. Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services. They said the housekeepers had all gone home. The restaurant was terrible service. One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day. Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered. We got our own flatware and coffee. The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry. I am allergic. Had to send it back. I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called. Called corporate and they wanted to give me points. Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a 50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for 50.00 No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again. The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks."
155,its also a naborhood pool.

157,"Cramped location with odd entry by traffic light, clearly caters to groups and sports teams. Nicest staff ever! Room was clean and comfortable, is a single story building, so rooms go on forever down long hallways. Lucky we were near the gym, which was better than most. Great breakfast at a very reasonable price. Room includes a voucher for up to 14.00 of your breakfast order, so you get a hot meal straight from the short order cook, not some steam table/cereal bar like most places. Portions were huge! Free buffet with pizza, cheese/crackers, veggies and dip from 4-7pm on Friday evenings in the bar. Facility is a bit quirky and a bit tired, but staff is warm and friendly. Wish we had eaten dinner there and not at the disappointing Chinese restaurant next door!"
158,"We enjoyed two great days away. They let us check in early and check out late for free. The hot tub was great, pool was a little loud because of school vacation but the attendant was the friendliest gentleman. Wifi didn't work well with just one of our three devices. Breakfast was definitely worth getting out of bed for. Will definitely consider staying there again for a getaway or business."
159,"This hotel is showing its age. Although my room was clean, everything seemed a little run-down. The carpets seemed old and the door frame had light from the hallway shining through it. The security latch was loose and missing at least one screw. I booked the room in a hurry for a last minute trip. When I got to Watervilled I remembered there are some much nicer places to stay such as the Hampton Inn and the Fireside Inn. For some reason I didn't see these on the hotels.com website."
160,Excellent for short stay. Very comfortable bed for good night's sleep. Breakfast a bit disorganised and could cause a problem if on tight schedule.
161,Excellent free breakfast & friendly staff.
162,Good parking for vehicles w/ trailers.
163,Old and run down. Tried to eat at the restaurant in the hote for breakfast and the service was so terrible we walked out. I would not stay there again.
164,"The room was very large, comfortable bed, very clean and most important it was very quiet. The breakfast was reasonably priced and very good!!"
165,"staff were great ,rooms very clean, bed was comfortable and very close for all your shopping needs"
166,"Room were clean, Bed was comfortable, bathroom was functional. Skip the breakfast the service is very, very slow and food is sub par, they overcooked the eggs Benedict I ordered, plus the cost of 4.25 for juice is expensive. I would recommend going across the street to the Governor's Restaurant Bakery. The front desk was very helpful and accommodating.... Dear Lawrence S - Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to write this review. We're glad you enjoyed your room and our helpful staff! I apologize that you did not enjoy your breakfast at O'Brien's. We will pass along your comments to their management!"

168,I've stayed here many times over the years while traveling through maine. Very friendly staff. Their pub has relatively tasty food too! Rooms are clean and the beds are so comfy! Rooms also have all the amenities you could need for your stay!
169,Nothing major to speak of however this hotel is quite comfortable
170,We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until 6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.
171,"Clean, comfortable. I really liked the shower and the shower curtain!"
172,"We did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of dogs, including a yappy one right next to us. But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room. The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee? I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to wait."
173,"The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog. However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the 'included breakfast', which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I've encountered in a while."
174,Room was good and very clean
175,"We booked this hotel about a week ahead of time and were pleased. The hotel was recently updated. The bathrooms were beautiful. Our beds were comfy and clean. The pool and hot tub was a nice touch compared to the chilly weather outside. The only downfall was that someone put our bill under the door in the morning and it was substantially lower than what I had paid through expedia. When I inquired, I was told that it was a mistake and that I should not have gotten a bill. Breakfast was tasty but kind of pricy in the restaurant, the hotel did give us a credit but only for the registered adults. Not a free continental as advertised."
176,the cleaning products they use leave a toxic scent in every hallway and room. I feel bad for the employees hazardousworkingconditions
177,We enjoyed ourselves. Loud at night in the hallway but it was a weekend night so it's to be expected.
178,"We had a wonderful, relaxing time. The staff were completely attentive and accommodating. We had a corner king room with a kitchen, two patios and a deluxe bathroom. You had to drive into town but they said that Uber is available if you need it. This was our first visit to Palm Springs and hopefully not our last! It really... More"
179,"The hotel was clean and the people at the front desk are happy to help. Same with the staff that took care of our breakfast order. The French toast was really good, same with the oatmeal the potatoes were missing that something special but not bad. Stay away from the turkey bacon.... overcooked circles of leathery meat. It was sort of annoying that there was so many people packed into the pool, that it wasn't worth going in, and that was the reason we choose the hotel. There were hockey, cheer, basketball, and gymnastics tournaments in town for the weekendSo hotels and restaurants all were at max capacity"
180,I was here for 5 days due to work. The hotel needs some updating and it could be cleaner. The staff is excellent and the restaurant has good food. I would stay here again
181,"Clean, reasonably comfortable, well maintained. Very nice breakfast, extremely reasonable price. If you can get a room facing the courtyard, it is very pleasant and quiet. Like many hotels these days, it seems to be run by kids, who are friendly but not terribly knowledgeable or resourceful. Overall a nice stay, what we expect from Best Western."
182,"met or exceeded all of our expectations, breakfast was included and was fantastic."
183,The room was clean and comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was very good.
184,Perfectly fine stay off the interstate. Accessible to downtown with car.
185,Excellent free breakfast friendly staff.
186,"Easy access off I 95. Extremely courteous desk staff. Clean room and common spaces. King -no smoking was indeed that with a very comfortable bed. Highway noise was minimal. Be sure to get your voucher for basic breakfast which is a hot, fresh breakfast for free! Great coffee. Plenty of parking and close to downtown Waterville for access to restaurants... More"
187,"The hotel was comfortable. It appeared to be popular with workers and truckers. Families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool, which I did not use. The restaurant appeared to be a place where contractors went."
188,We were touring colleges for the week and this was my least favorite hotel. It just did not feel very can and up to date. The location is convenient to Colby.
189,"We were in Palm Springs on the day the temperature was 123 degrees! Despite that, we had a wonderful stay because of the Little Paradise hotel. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and all of the little complimentary touches were so nice, like a bottle of wine for us in the fridge, sun care products near the pool, and a... More"
190,Went up for a family visit. The room was clean and the staff friendly. Had a good meal in the restaurant. Convenient to stores of you forget anything.
191,"Needed a convenient reasonably priced hotel for a college reunion.this hotel fit the bill.the room was clean, the staff courteous, and the breakfast buffet (included in the room cost) good."
192,"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair."
193,This was a nice place to stay.
194,"Smell of freshly smoked marijuana in the halls on the way to the pool all day long. Hotel is suppose to be family friendly and staff was walking through the same halls and didn't appear to care. Pool was rented out to a birthday party of non guests to the hotel so overpacked and could not swim. Later it was quite dirty and the hot tub had hair and dirt floating in it. Was given 2 towels and washclothes for a room with 4 people. Shower only got luke warm. Free breakfast advertised was not free. ""Free"" is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity. Website and book in room states there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not. They have soda and ice machines only. Very disappointing."
195,"Great location, easy access to the city"
196,It's warm and normal.... staff is diligent and polite. Price is a function in these parts and I appreciate the consistency of service.
197,"If you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs & cold cereal, juice. We didn't use the pool, no time for that."
198,"I am in Waterville every year for fire department training and always go home disappointed about the local accommodations.  This year my hotel was clean, quiet and very comfortable.  Aside from a bartender who had no personality the stay was perfect."
199,"nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased."
200,We arrived in Palm Springs not sure what to expect.... it's a quiet kinda place in 'low season'.... we drove down what appeared to be a residential street... parked up at a wooden gate and weren't sure what to expect. What awaited took us back in amazement... the room is spacious with an air of decadence... the welcome wine and comprehensive breakfast was more than... More
201,Well they must be in the midst of renovations because they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways. It was like the workers just up and left everything out in the open and materials all over the place. The beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit. The blinds were duct taped together and the parking lights came through the curtains. And the continental breakfast was a joke. My family went down at 8:15 am and they had nothing ready. Needless to say I am never going to stay there again and we checked out early and went to eat at the Friendly's next door where it was cleaner. I wish that I can get my money refunded because it was not worth the money that I spent.

203,"Easy to access from I-95, close to restaurants, shopping, nice little town."
204,We only stayed one night but this is a good place to stay. Newly updated it shows with better mattresses and new decor. The hotel is clean and well laid out. It is centrally located with many places to eat. The only negatives were the wifi which seems to become very slow once the hotel filled up and one tv... More
205,"Overall we were very satisfied with our stay. We were glad to see that many renovations are in the process of being completed, and hopefully will continue. The rooms are dated, but clean. We had dinner in the bar area and breakfast in the dining room. Both were excellent with generous portions! If the need arises, we would definitely stay at this property again."
206,This is one of the friendliest hotels that I have stayed in. All of the staff was very helpful with anything that I needed during my stay. The hotel was clean and well decorated. I will be staying here again.
207,"No problems, except that it would be good if you would provide tea bags for the people, like me, who do not drink coffee. Also, you should use larger type for your questionnaire, for those, like me, whose vision is not all that good."
208,Check in was quick. The room was comfortable.
209,I booked 2 separate days for my stay. Upon checking in they told me that I had one stay booked. It was annoying however we were able to straighten things out
210,Nice hotel for the price. Great for a short stay. Breakfast discount a nice touch. One of the best inclusive breakfast I have had!
211,"This place really is a little paradise!! A beautiful boutique style hotel with EVERYTHING meticulously thought out to make our vacation perfect. Saltwater pool, fresh fruit, BEST showerhead I've ever experienced, I can go on and on. The bed was so comfortable and we slept like babies. Victor did a wonderful job and Judy was just lovely and personable!"
212,Gave me excellent directions to my n ext destination
213,"Need more staff in restraunt on busy weekend. Sat. morning breakfast a disaster. Long wait, wrong order. Otherwise a very good stay. And much better than in past years."
214,"When we got to the hotel our room was not available and they tried to give us a double twin bed room when we had payed for a king size. Then we had to wait a half hour for our room, even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already. We also had ants in our room. Overall it was not a great stay,and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore. I used to stay in them a good amount, and I am sorry to say that but that is how I feel."
215,it was very good
216,"We travel and shop in Maine once or sometimes twice a month ever year and normally we stay in Bangor, sometimes we would even travel a little more south to Augusta and drive right by Waterville. Now this isn't the first time we stayed here, maybe half a dozen times, but this is my first review. We realized that inflated... Dear Wayne Jean - We're so happy you enjoyed your stay! Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel! Look forward to your next stay with us, and truly hope to see you again soon."
217,"Even though I booked/payed through Expedia, when they swiped my credit card for incidentals they somehow charged another room to my card.  Two days later, still waiting for the charge to be removed from my card."
218,Hotel is just off Interstate and easy to get to anywhere U need to go!!
219,excellent place to stay and food was super... great breakfast and friendly staff
220,"WiFi didn't work at all for my entire stay. Drain in bathtub very slow, takes a long time to get hot water."
221,Rooms fairly small and bathroom really needs updating. Bed was a nice size! Not very good value for money and little to do within a walking distance.
222,"We loved staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!"
223,Spent 3 nights at Little Paradise boutique hotel on a mother-daughter trip. Wonderful and relaxing experience. Clean and newly redone rooms that are well equipped and spacious. Perfect location off the main street in a quiet neighborhood that is close to downtown Palm Springs. The pool area has a nice gas fire pit area and lots of comfy chaise lounges... More
224,"I had a nice time at the Best Western Hotel. It was clean and the staff was friendly. the work out area and pool was a good size and the hot tub was relaxing. the restaurant was resealable, but the only thing there I didn't like was getting a water with dinner that came in a plastic cup. Over all it was a nice stay."

228,"I was in room 216, on the 2nd floor. I found it very convenient that each floor had a close-by drink vending machine and ice machine. We were able to do laundry for cheap up on the third floor. The pool area was nice, relaxing hot tub. I have a disability where I have a hard time walking so I... Dear erincorbo - Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review! We're happy you enjoyed your stay, the hotel, the staff, and our pool, and hope you'll be sure to stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the Waterville area :)"
229,"then the seiday has indeed been on the other hand the surprise is about the dï/2/2 included, I note that there is an allocated amount on the other hand if they are willing to surplus, should be increased to the amount of the amount of the dï/1/2-to-day amount or indicate it on the card as a dï-ïunï 1/2 to the outside of the h'1/2/elettel become more economical"

The reservation was for 3. Just a set of 2 towels. We had the heat full blast, and we froze in the middle of the night. Very poor managed!"
231,was promised an executive suite... got jammed into a small room with a micro wave and fridge and they called that executive.carpet was not clean .. no other trooms available when concerns were voiced
232,"First time at a BW Plus and we were pleasantly surprised. Very clean, very comfortable, staff amazing and best breakfast ever. To be truthful, there was no downside including the price, which was very fair"
233,"Needed to leave a day sooner than expected, knew this at check in and told them so. But since I had booked thru Expedia, they stated that I had to get approval thru them, which I did. Upon check-out I asked to verify that I was only being charged for the 3 nights as opposed to the 4, and they said I was only being charged for the 3 days, and gave me a receipt showing that. But the next day, my credit card used for that stay posted the amount for a 4 night stay. In calling the front desk, I got form letter like answers. I will never use this Best Western hotel or Expedia again."
234,"This little hotel surpassed all my expectations. The rooms are well equiped with a little kitchenette, fridge was filled with croissants, 3 bottles of water, soda and much more. The room was very clean and the bathroom was equiped with a top notch shower. I would definately recommend this place to anyone visiting or passing trough Palm Springs. The reception... More"
235,All of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of nooks and crannies to the hallways of this hotel. So therefore anyone could walk in and be hiding anywhere.

238,"Great hotel to stay ,,Was there for my niece to see Unity college"
239,"Our room was adequate except for the burn marks in the sink, poor tile work in the bathroom, and a malfunctioning heating/cooling unit. The unit made odd snapping noises periodically, had to be set on the lowest setting to not overheat the room (58 degree setting made it about 70). The unit leaked water onto the carpet and showed signs of having been ""patched"" with aluminum foil."
240,"We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a 14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!"
241,Nice! Friendly! Quiet good breakfast nice stall free newspaper
242,"Wonderful stay, Staff was so helpful"
243,Hotel was clean and decent.. Service staff were friendly and helpful.
244,Staff was very nice rooms could have been I little bigger over all it was good
245,"If you want peaceful and relaxing look no further. Although set up like a single floor motel it is hardly anything but. The rooms are very nice with a full kitchen. They provide some breakfast items, snacks and bottles of spring water. You can bring in anything you like to enjoy at the pool or in your room. By the... More"
246,Hotel had all the amenities and the included breakfast which was fantastic. Best of any hotel I ever stayed at. Ordered off the menu for a minimal extra charge. Room was clean and roomy.
247,My children love the pool especially for the temperature of salt water and ambient air. Especially after a cross-country ski trip in the morning (5 km) and afternoon shopping. The days were full.
248,Staff was very nice and helpful. We ended up arriving earlier than expected and when I called to see if we could check in early; the response was very welcoming. My only critique would be the constant slamming of doors in the morning by housekeeping. They use the lock bar to keep the door in-locked while they go in and out to clean. The problem then becomes the constant loud slamming of doors
249,"The house keeping staff was kind, but when I asked for things for the room they would tell me to get them myself. The restaurant was not good and the service was worse. One waitress told off another in front of everyone and another waiter ignored our table after taking our order."
250,the cleaning products they use leave a toxic scent in every hallway and room. I feel bad for the employees #hazardousworkingconditions
251,"The room was very spacious. It had a good size fridge, decent microwave and coffee pot. The furnishings were very nice especially the granite topped vanity in the bathroom. Linens were nice and bed comfortable. I loved that there are many, many plugs, a large desk and good office chair at the desk. The restaurant is very good. The pool... More"
252,This hotel is located right off the highway. Check in was a little off to the right. I thought the entrance should have been located closer to the check in area. Instead it was in between the hotel and connected function facility. Pros: The room was clean & comfortable. Check out is at NoonCons: The door would not close by itself & the water in the shower backed up.
253,Went up for a family visit. The room was clean and the staff friendly. Had a good meal in the restaurant. Convenient to stores of you forget anything.
254,our stay was great.my grandson really enjoyed the pool. My son & wife took advantage of the fitness center.would have liked to see the menu with prices otherwise great
255,"Overall, happy with the hotel. Good Value here. Here's a quick tip for weary travelers - grab a hot and ready 5$ pizza from the Little Caesars that is two doors down."
256,All the reviews are great and agree on this fine little place. I'd also like to add the wonderful service you will find here with Victor and staff who seem to want to do anything and everything to make you happy. The king beds here are just amazing. We seldom run into beds this comfy. The room has a large... More
257,"Delightful stay, nice room, good workout facility and pool, handy to Colby, but slooow service in the restaurant."
258,"the property is ageing and shows it how ever they are remodeling a little at a time. The staff was the best of the best . a great Irish pub and Restaurant. unfortunately no entertainment not even a Juke Box. The staff here was Fabulous. the pool, Hot tub and Exercise room were top shelf."
259,"Awesome hotel, we brought our 6 month old son and he absolutely loved the saltwater pool it actually helped his dry skin he had on his back. We took turns trying the hot tub which was amazing as well. Had a beer in the bar and ordered dinner to bring back to the room, the bar tender was very friendly and food was good too. Overall our stay was an A+!!"
260,good
261,"The room was clean and in good condition. The walls thin, so heard people in the halls and the fridge was noisy. The staff was excellent from check-in to the restaurant. Food was good and a good value. The Pool area was ok, However the Hot Tub was broken and in poor working condition."
262,Enjoyed staying
263,"The hotel is OK. We stay there because of the big, warm, indoor salt water pool. Service could be better - concierge didn't give us the wi-fi log in at check in; we had to call to get it. Guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu - not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were. The restaurant opens at 7 and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive. The first thing the waitress told us when we walked in was that she just seated a large party and it was going to be a while. Then she left. We had to order overpriced cereal and oatmeal and wolf it down."
264,Overall not bad
265,"I thought the place was great. IMy only problem was that they didn't have the hot tub that Hotels.com had listed. Otherwise, the place was clean, modern and convenient. The beds were really comfortable. The food in the restaurant not so much. We got a coupon for $7 off per person for breakfast but we waited over 40 minutes for our breakfast and when it did arrive it was cold."
266,hotel room clean - beds comfy - advertised free wi-fi in rm and our rm had no wi-fi and when I went to the lobby they had 3 computers but only 1 worked. Free breakfast was really bad.
267,We went for a relaxing weekend as an offshoot of a family visit. This was a great place to go with a nice room and a view of the mountains from just outside. The ONLY thing we didn't like was that the sun dropped below the mountains too early and the temperature dropped along with it. Maybe you can fix... More
268,The pool and hot tub area was wonderful!    The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves. We wanted them to have fun and not have a pool attendant constantly on top of them.  The fitness room was big and spacious.
269,slept like a baby!!! :)
270,We only stayed 2 nights to visit people we know in the area
271,This hotel was extremely clean and staff was excellent and friendly. Would highly recommend friends to stay here. Plan on returning. Hope it stays as is. There is nothing to improve. Even let your four-legged friends stay. Wonderful hotel and state!!!
272,We only spent a night - got there late and left early morning. Front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. AC unit was very noisy.
273,"We were spending only 1 night to help out with my Dad. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, Our room was on the first floor, which I normally do not like, was very spacious (desk, sitting chair, refrigerator, large TV King Bed). The bathroom had been refurbished with a nice vanity and new surround for tub and shower... More"
274,"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area."
275,"This hotel is great. My only negative review would be the comfort of the bed. I was very firm, so much that I couldn't get comfortable. Just not my preference. Pool us great, food in the restaurant is good. Staff is very friendly."
276,"Ok overall - we stayed one night with our dogs. We were limited in our choices because of this. Hotel could use updating. Was a little bit noisy in the halls, but overall ok. Did not eat on site but at Governor's across the street."
277,Staff very friendly.  Some areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but some do not.  Room was clean but halls looked dated and worn.  I have not stayed in other hotels in area so I don'the have a basis for comparison.  Convenient to highway.
278,"We were on a business trip to Anaheim and, afterwards, drove to Palm Springs for a relaxing weekend. It turned out that this hotel was the perfect place! We arrived late and were pleasantly surprised upon checking in to see that, not only were the accommodations incredibly thoughtful and comfortable, but the refrigerator came stocked with croissants, bagels, cream cheese,... More"
279,The pool and hot tub area was wonderful! The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves. We wanted them to have fun and not have a pool attendant constantly on top of them. The fitness room was big and spacious.
280,"I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didn't seem like other people were smoking, so that's good. You get a $7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
281,"Great breakfast, clean room! Nice staff, friendly and helpful. Large, comfortable room."
282,Just a bad experience. Convenience is the only item this Hotel offers.
283,The hotel is great for a three star - best thing about it really is the staff - very helpful
284,I'm from the city and found it to be comfortable and quiet-- my friend is from the country and was bothered by the lights from the outside and the late-night chatter of guests next door.
285,"The hotel was fine overall, but when I grabbed the last bath towel I found it to be of rag quality. It was literally frayed on the end and you could see thin patches when the towel was held up. For $100 per night, I would expect better quality. The hotel room was neat and clean and staff was friendly. I would stay again, but check the towels before I needed to use one! Nice pool and hot tub area."
286,"We have stayed here on two different occasions and could not be happier. Very clean !!! Staff pleasant and helpful. Includes a real breakfast at a real restaurant on site. We love that! And husband with back issues really likes the salt water pool and hot tub. I go for the treadmill. Overall we look forward to staying at Best... Dear E5985FNmarye - Thank you for the taking the time to write this awesome review! We're happy you enjoyed your time with us, and look forward to having you back to rest and relax with us again soon!"
287,We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until @6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.
288,staff very nice. clean place.
289,"Victor and Judy were truly accommodating hosts, especially when we had to cut our stay short due to illness. Everything that has been written by other reviewers was spot on. It is more like a small inn or bed breakfast (with the breakfast left in the fridge in your room) than a hotel. There are eight guest rooms around... More"
290,"Very loud rowdy customers staff would not do anything about the frat like partying.  Pool was good, hot tub was disgusting.  I really do not have anything good to say about this hotel.  I will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone."
291,The motel was very nice place and the staff were great at all time. They were ready to help all the time. My wife sister died while we were there. They could not do enough for us. The only thing is they keep it to cold at he front desk and restaurant. We would stay there the next time we go buy.
292,"Excellent hotel. I was there for a conference and found it to be in a good central location. The room was very comfortable, clean and was the perfect spot to stay. I also enoyed having the restaurant/bar right in the hotel. I would happily stay here again."
293,The hotel was as good as it was advertised to be.  The attached restaurant was better than expected; the food was reasonably priced and of excellent quality.  Everyone was friendly and very helpful.  We would most definately stay here again.
294,The staff was fantastic.  Nice room.  Could have used more than 2 bath towels.  It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter.  I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim. It was a good stay and I would stay there again.
295,"overall an 8, breakfast was acceptable (better last few times before) upgraded cable service would make stay much better. matress on both double beds on third floor way too soft but had no problems with 1st ir second floors at earlier stays."
296,"There puddles located throughout the hotel that should have been vacuumed up but weren't. The pub furniture had seen better days. The restuarant had no heat one morning for breakfast. Nothing seemed to be working. This hotel needs a complete makeover. The workout facitlies are shared with the local peoples, who buy membership - so competition to use treadmills with folks other than those staying at the hotel. I had a sirlion steak for dinner and it was 3/4 fat, advertised with cajun spices - it had none - tasted as though it was thawed and boilded in water - disgusting. The vegitables were so mushy you couldn't pick them up with your fork. I would avoid this hotel until they do some major renovations!"
297,"Stayed here while doing some lake fishing for a few nights. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every. Wifi works well. Comes with voucher for breakfast. I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good. You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain $ credit. Eggs, french toast and pancakes with fresh Maine blueberries very good. Yogurt parfait with granola also yummy. Located on a busy street, many shops and places to eat right there."
298,"We will not be staying at this hotel again. Our room had no heat, the shower curtain had mold on it and the hotel was not very clean. We tried to go to the pool/hot tub but it was packed. There was a birthday party at the pool at 7:30 at night for a pre-teen boy. It was very loud and the pool area smelled horrible. Then to top it all off the bed was horribly uncomfortable."
299,Crazy lady at the desk would not give me a receipt - she said I had to get if from hotel. Com. And the guest computer / business's center had such a strong fire wall I could not open my flash drive to open my documents and micro soft office. The man in the hot tub followed me into the locker room and made an offer to give me free whatever - that's not the hotels fault just kinda crazy . Not a bad place.
300,"If you want to relax, want a quiet atmosphere, cozy setting.. this is the place. It is definitely a smaller, boutique-type hotel and it feels that way. So that's good for some and maybe not as much for others. The room is great, very pretty. Very impressive large, new Curved HD TV. So that's nice! The small kitchen is also... More"
301,"We were in Waterville for our Colby reunion. Hotel was fine. Service was pretty slow in the hotel restaurant where we had our breakfast, but luckily we were not in a rush. Breakfast was fine, waitstaff pleasant."
302,The food at breakfast was good but we had to wait 40 minutes to get it because there was only one cook working.
303,I was here for 5 days due to work. The hotel needs some updating and it could be cleaner. The staff is excellent and the restaurant has good food. I would stay here again
304,"The hotel was nice in the front however our room was showing it's wear.  The carpet was stained and in pretty bad shape however everything else was fine.  Beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean.  TV channels were not that great however that was not a major issue.  As the hotel is under renovation, I am hoping that carpets and windows are part of the reno.  Would probably stay there again."
305,"Typical, but clean and dog friendly room. Food and service at O'Brien's Restaurant and Pub was top notch! Sarah was a most pleasant and dedicated bar tender and server. Enjoyed our evening of food and conversation. Dear Sandbar16 - Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review! We hope you'll be back with us again in the future. We'll be sure to pass along your kind words to Sarah at O'Brien's."
306,"The Best Western Plus brand is consistently decent, and this hotel did not disappoint. It was nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room- a huge plus!"
307,The hotel was right off the highway but not so close as to experience traffic noises. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. I have stayed at a lot of hotels this year and this one by far was the best. Great bed. Slept like a log and woke refreshed. We ate at the in hotel resteraunt and were extreemly pleased. overall A++
308,"Hotel well located, the small lunch had to be included but only for two!! We were 2 plus 2 children, so we had to pay the two little children extra lunches."
309,"Hotel well located, the small lunch had to be included but only for two!! We were 2 plus 2 children, so we had to pay the two little children extra lunches."
310,HVAC was a problem that cause not a good sleep Restaurant service was slow not attending properly (not good service for businessman )
311,"Stayed 5 nights and it was delightful. Lovely comfortable,well lit, great shower and bathroom,kitchen with microwave,fridge etc and very functional room. Ten hotels on this trip but this one seems to have thought of everything. Peaceful yet near the main streets with lovely shopping, art and some great restaurants. Good local transport but downtown is walkable but a bit over... More"
312,Room was really dry. And I got a rash from the salt water pool.
313,Good
314,"We had a good time, restuarant inside the hotel is kind of pricey but besides that it was a good time."
315,Uninspiring and tired looking... I should have booked the Hotel across the street which looked newer was cheaper... and next to a Starbucks....
316,"We found this motel to be pleasant, clean and affordable. Very helpful staff. Attached Irish bar/restaurant we great. The breakfast voucher for the restaurant was a delightful surprise for a real breakfast. I would highly recommend this Best Western"
317,"Ok place, needs some paint and new clean carpet. Stains on bed cover."
318,"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair."
319,"The hotel was under renovations when we got there, that would have been nice to know prior to booking, it just didn't look nice from the outside and some area on the inside also. Other than that the staff were nice and accomodating, it was convenient to have a full restaurant/pub in the hotel, for different optionsat breakfast, not just a continental breakfast bar. The housekeeper cleaned our room when we were out and took a knife and pizza pan that belonged to me (obviously thinking it belonged to the hotel) and the restaurant staff managed to scour the kitchen, find and return them to me before I left (not an easy task to find one knife). All in all it was a nice stay, and I wouldn't mind returning, I would like to see the improvements."
320,The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.
321,"very convenient for over night stay right off the I 95. restaurant & pub in hotel, gas station across street and other fast food restaurant up the road and a few shopping stores."
322,"New everything would be great from the moment we came through the gate. Nine excellent, high quality rooms each with a small kitchen/diner and terrific shower room including twin wash basins. Each room faces onto the pool with plenty of sun loungers, towels, shaded areas and comfortable seating. Rooms furnished to extremely high standard and beds have the finest linen... More"
323,Nice rooms. Very clean. Front staff was polite and courteous.
324,Nice and friendly staff
325,"Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel is in close proximity to Colby College Museum of Art (great collection of regional and international artists). O'Brien's Irish Restaurant and Pub is located on the property and offers a good selection of breakfast and dinner options. My understanding is hat this hotel was recently upgraded, although it is hard to tell colors and... More"
326,This hotel is used for Winter Romp each year . The cost is not too expensive . The room is a good size . There was two beds in the room. It is in good condition for the price we pay . There is lots of parking . Breakfast was included which was great . Will return again to thus...
327,Hotel was convenient to I95 and well above average in appearance and appointments. Staff was very gracious and accommodating. We were passing through so one night stay. Did not eat in restaurant because alternatives were very close by. Rate was not a bargain but worth the price.
328,"Hotel was good. Indoor pool was the draw AND it was actually very warm. Great job! However, I do NOT recommend eating at the hotel restaurant... HORRIBLE service, so/so food quality. With only 3 people at the bar and 2 in restaurant it shouldn't have taken 35 minutes to get an order of nachos, then when it came out, the order was wrong!! Waited another 30 mins for the main dish. Pasta over cooked, chicken rubbery, even my 4 yr old wouldn't eat it. Good stay, but eat elsewhere."
329,"Conveniently located, very efficient staff, reasonably priced."
330,Location of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from downtown (by car) to Waterville. The only complaint I would voice would be that the outer door that was used for entry to the building in the back of the hotel was kept open at night due to a broken lock. This added a sense of less security to me as a single traveler.
331,"To our surprise the hotel was under a major reintivation, with construction materials everywhere, cluttered throughout, dirty and not well maintained. The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experienced. No security at the hotel, as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter. Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible. If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel. Worst experience at a hotel in my life time. To top it off, we paid way too much for the room based on the experience and status of the property. Terrible experience!"
332,I only booked this hotel because it was dog friendly
333,Lovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. Staff were welcoming and helpful.
334,"Spend four days there and would have prolonged our stay if they only had a room available. Welcoming host, all rooms around the patio / pool. This place breathes tranquility and relaxation. Since you normally travel by car in this country anyways, everything is close by."
335,The hotel was okay the hotel was fine I must put a bunch of words in here to tell you simply that the hotel was okay.
336,Halls reeked of marijuana. Pool was overpacked with non guests from a birthday party rental. They offer memberships to the pool and exercise room to non guests. Pool was not very clean. Was given 2 towels and wash clothes for 4 people in a room. Website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also. Website and book in room said there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines. Shower was luke warm and no way to make it warmer. Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.
337,"My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay, the rooms were VERY clean, the staff courteous and the hospitality OUTSTANDING. Please post these comments, thanks. Joe"
338,"We found this hotel while travelling and had read a few bad reviews due to it being renovated!!! We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!! In this day and age, smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable!! I hope this hotel changes their policy as it would be a shame to ruin such a great Reno,d to new hotel!!"
339,"We stayed here for 1 night. Rooms were clean and relatively comfortable. The restaurant is more of a bar and we were the only people that ate there that evening (there seemed to be quite a few people in the bar end though), the waiter was very helpful, the food was average (burgers, sandwiches and fries). NB breakfast is not... More"
340,"Excellent value, nice clean room , quiet, had fun at the bar our bartender was REALY nice and friendly. For sure this would be my second home if it wasn't so far away from my Massachusetts home. Would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in the area. Dear T2359WMstephenb - Thanks so much for the kind words! We are glad you enjoyed your stay, and we look forward to having you back with us on your next trip to the area :)"
341,I had a wonderful time at the best Western. My kids loved the pool and jetted spa. The staff where friendly and helpful.
342,"We have stayed here a couple of times. The rooms are ok, the facilities are ok, the staff is terrific. The staff is very friendly and service oriented, they are what keep us coming back. There is a pool and work out area. The restaurant could use some updating. The rooms were clean."
343,We had business to attend to in Waterville
344,"This hotel is absolutely disgusting! You could not pay me to stay here again. We requested a non smoking room , but the entire first floor smelled of smoke!! Rooms are very old and dark. Shower which I was even scared to step into barefoot didn't get above Luke warm. The little coffee machine in the room also didn't work.. it was just bad all the way around!! I wasn't expecting fancy being a best western but clean and not outdated would have been nice! Stay elsewhere! !"
345,"I'm going to keep this fairly short but what I will say is if you are going to stay in Palm Springs please stay here. It's not right on the main drag but it's in a lovely residential area, no noise, ample parking and just so peaceful. Only 5 in an Uber to the main strip with the bars and... More"
346,Upgraded motel with an extremely comfortable bed and quiet room on the top (third) floor. We enjoyed our breakfast and the allowance (14) given to cover breakfast. I definitely would consider staying at the Best Western Plus if I was staying in Waterville again.
347,"My family stayed at this hotel and had a great weekend. The pool was huge and my kids loved it. The restaurant gives you a hot breakfast, not a microwaved one and the rooms were very clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I want to thank the staff for a fun weekend away!!!"
348,I enjoyed having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the $14.00 breakfast voucher
349,"Room, Pool and Restaurant were better than expected for a Best Western."
350,"The room was great! Lots of space, good full-length mirrors, and an excellent bed. The closet could have been better. It was very shallow and needed to be deeper for clothes to hang properly."
351,Hotel Room was clean and comfortable.  We would recommend. We stayed because we were visiting Thomas College.
352,"All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in.  The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean.  Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services.  They said the housekeepers had all gone home.  The restaurant was terrible service.  One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day.  Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered.  We got our own flatware and coffee.  The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry.  I am allergic.  Had to send it back.  I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called.  Called corporate and they wanted to give me points.  Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a $50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for $50.00  No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again.  The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks."
353,"hot tub too hot,(over 100),but pool was great.room was clean and bed was very comfortable.toilet was too small as was the bath room.but I felt safe . breakfast is big $$$ otherwise ok"

358,"I was attending a business conference in the area. I chose this hotel for it's location, price, and because they have a pool and fitness room on-site. The Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and well appointed. I enjoyed using the fitness room, but the pool was a nightmare. Despite the fact that there were signs everywhere saying,... More"
359,I would recommend this hotel to family and friends. All the staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and decorated very well.

360,"Two pillowcases and the sheet had hair on it. I think just left over from the a laundering process but still disconcerting and if we had not arrived so late at night, I would have asked to switch rooms."
361,This hotel was nice. Nothing extra. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. Would stay here again.
362,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Grand. It was an older hotel buy very comfortable, and the pool and the hot tub were clean. And even though there is a restaurant there, they also provided a continental breakfast. This worked out well for us, because we did not have time for a sit down breakfast the morning we checked out."
363,overall pleasant  good breakfast. clean room easy to get to.
364,"Connectivity in the rooms is a joke. Go somewhere else if you need internet. Imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full, the toilets were going to flush every once in a while, and that the best idea would be to flush when no one else was in the hotel. Apart from the internet, the place... More"

369,"We stayed for a funeral. They gave us a heavily discounted bereavement rate. The staff was very nice for the most part. Front desk staff was amazing. They made a room available to our parties to get away from the bar/restaurant, because it was wing night for the locals. Pool attendant wasn't friendly, but everyone is entitled to a bad... Dear BostonParker - Thank you for taking the time to write this kind review, and I'm so sorry for your loss, and that it was a funeral that brought you to our property. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay, even under the circumstances, and I apologize that some of the interactions you had were not representative of the majority of..."
370,"Having moved rooms because of noise twice, I'm still waiting for the manager to return my call!! Three times I have left messages for the none existing manager. I hope the owner is aware of the poor service the hotel provides at its front desk and office! Dear Allpro63, Thank you for taking the time to write this review. We appreciate your feedback. My sincere apologies that you had to move rooms twice during your stay. Sometimes noise is beyond our control but we do try to do our best for each guest. Thank you!"
371,"We had a wonderful night staying in this hotel for one night. Easy, clean, friendly, convenient. I loved that we got a voucher for $ off breakfast at the attached restaurant. We had a great stay."
372,"My two daughters and I stayed in the hotel's suite for a local dance competition. The room was nice and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom could have been cleaner, but overall we were happy."
373,Nice stop over hotel near some shops.   The hotel had a pool and hot tub but these could do with some work.   Had a nice friendly bar to relax in.
374,"The room was very small, the cable was fuzzy and not HD, and all the doors stuck or were not properly fitted for the opening. This was a $90 room, not at $150 room. Way over priced for location and condition. Not what I would expect from Best Western."
375,"This hïïe is complete and lasting an atmosphere without charm, even sad. However, the bed is of good quality and the shower works well."
376,"From check in to the day we left very comfortable and rooms were verhy clean , staff very helpful"
377,"The hotel was adequate and met my basic needs. It met my expectations for this type of hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The TV was difficult to use - you couldn't get directly to a specific channel and it didn't have all the network channels, presumably b/c it was DirectTV. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee/tea and muffins so I wouldn't really call it a continental breakfast."
378,"This place is just perfect for everyone looking for some rest in lovely and warm Palm Springs. The host welcomed us very very friendly, explaining us what we could find where. The private kitchen had our breakfast and a complimentary bottle of wine. The room (call it the appartment) had everything and was very well decorated and had an outside... More"
379,Great place to stay when visiting your child at Colby! The hotel is convenient to campus. Rooms are good - beds are comfortable. Breakfast is good. Fitness center looks decent. We will stay there again when visiting Colby.
380,The motel was very nice place and the staff were great at all time. They were ready to help all the time. My wife sister died while we were there. They could not do enough for us. The only thing is they keep it to cold at he front desk and restaurant. We would stay there the next time we go buy.
381,This best Western Plus was average. The room was clean. The king bed comfortable. Convenient location close to I-95. Decent breakfast.
382,The first room we were assigned smelled like sewer. They gladly moved us and the 2nd room was fine. No complaints about the room.
383,"Wonderful stay, Staff was so helpful"
384,"Room was clean, spacious and comfortable, Restaurant (O'Reily's) was charming with modestly priced good food, but limited menu. We had a back inside room which was quiet and easily accessed. They include a breakfast beginning at 7:00 but we had to leave before 7 so cannot comment on the breakfast."
385,"This place was right off the highway, but not too noisy. The rooms were spacious and clean. There was a pool and exercise room. But the best part was O'Brien's, where you could get meals and drinks on the premises. Lively atmosphere, with good food and great service."
386,"On our trip to Canada from Connecticut, We stayed the night in this lovely hotel. They brought the suitcases to our rooms in record time, and there were cookies and juice waiting for all visitors. Add to that a lovely buffet breakfast in the morning before we got on our way. It was a great experience with clean rooms and... More"
387,Problematic wifi
388,"one handicap parking spot per entrance , broken bed, not handicap friendly. internet never worked over two days. Told front desk I couldn't walk far so I need something close to the exit they put me as far away as they could,"
389,to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
390,"The hotel was fine, just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors. O'Brien's was a nice surprise, good food and great service.  Also, a true breakfast is included with the price of the room, cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet.  The internet speed was good as well."
391,Nice and friendly staff
392,"Room was very large and comfortable. Bed was also very comfortable. Staff was very friendly. We stayed here on our way to Nova Scotia. Breakfast was buffet and was very good, many items to choose from. Suit cases brought to room very quickly."
393,Nice rooms. Very clean. Front staff was polite and courteous.
394,"1.) We live out of town and we stayed at this hotel because my fianc had to work 12 hours on Friday in Waterville and had to be to work very early on Saturday for another 10 hour day, we stayed thinking he would get more rest. 2.) I wanted to order room service however the guest information booklet if... More"
395,Stayed night for my son's birthday. Kids had a blast loved the pool. Restaurant attached has smallest menu I've ever seen and aweful service but the hotel was fine! Clean rooms comfortable beds and the Xbox hooked up to the TV easily.
396,This hotel was nice. Nothing extra. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. Would stay here again.
397,It ws just an over night but very good accommodations
398,We have stayed at this Best Western several times. The rooms are clean. The staff is courteous and helpful and the breakfast is decent. It is very close to the highway but we never heard the traffic. Worth the money
399,"The hotel was excellent in all aspects. Lobby was warm and friendly, staff was knowledgeable. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. My one night stay was outstanding. The location of this best western was right off the interstate highway with plenty of restaurants to choose from. It also had it's own restaurant."
400,"Little Paradise is called a hotel, but it is more of a motel tucked away in a nice neighborhood district with similar styled single story boutique motels/hotels. This is not your large chain full service hotel but a nice hideaway with just a few rooms surrounding a warm salt water swimming pool. There is no on-site restaurant but you get... More"

418,Lovely stay Lucky with the weather so we could sit outside and have dinner
419,"Hotel well located©, the© breakfast had to be included but only for two!! We were 2 plus 2 children, so we had to pay the two extra ©©seals"
420,"Clean hotel. Great breakfast. Good value. O'Brien's restaurant makes a great breakfast that is individually prepared, not the typical rubber egg buffet that you get at most hotels. Good deal for the price. I will go there again for my next business trip to Waterville."
421,"The hotel has come of age and has hardly been renewed. The location is suitable for car travellers as a stage stop, because it is located directly on the motorway. It was pleasant that there was no typical American breakfast buffet, but one was served at the table. When booking, there was a loan of 7 USD per person, which was sufficient for a simple time."
422,"Pathetic and discriminatory. They have a free shuttle service, but it is not accessible to wheelchair users, and they don't care. The front desk did not do anything about the issue. I emailed the corporate customer care email address and they take unreasonable amounts of time to respond to emails and do not remedy the problem. The customer care email... More"

Had breakfast at the restaurant the next morning and it was awesome -- complete with waitresses, juice and eggs cooked to order. Best breakfast on our trip. Hotel gives you a voucher, so you have to pay a little money for the breakfast, but it was... More"
425,"We stayed for the weekend, good area for shopping, the place needs a little updating, but the staff more than makes up for that. We go there because of the pool and hot tub. They have a very nice breakfast plan where you can order what you like from their restaurant for the breakfast."
426,"This hotel is very conveniently located just off I-95 (there's a Ruby Tuesday Restaurant just a short walk away - we had a nice dinner there). The staff at check-in was not very friendly (they just did their basic job and didn't look quite happy). Our room was clean and spacious (king sized bed, flatscreen tv, fridge, microwave and a...

427,"Pool staff do not enforce rules. Many adults buy memberships to the pool and fitness center, therefore have an expectation that they will be able to use the facility as it is intended. Instead, there are frequently screaming and out of control children at the pool, especially on weekends. The rooms are very nice, as is the restaurant ."
428,"Not looking to break the bank on a hotel overnight - looking for clean, quiet and comfortable. This hotel fit the bill. We were 2 adults and a teen, so wish they had larger than double-sized beds, and it would have been better to have had 3 bath towels instead of 2. But the TV worked, the heat worked, the... More"

This in itself wasn't a big issue however,... More"
430,We enjoyed our stay. It was quiet even though there were many teenagers staying there. The breakfast was delicious. The people at the desk were very helpful and informative. We would certainly return to this hotel.
431,"My wife and my in-laws stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend. We chose it because they are pet friendly, up to 85 pounds I believe. Our room was as nice as you would expect from a Best Western. The room service did not turn the heat off during the day so it was sweltering at night when we got back. The... More"

433,This Comfort Suites was a terrific hotel. The staff was friendly and the room was clean and a good size. There was great food for breakfast and a large variety. It was very convenient for our trip. We went to an Astros game and the drive was about 18 minutes. We went to the Johnson Space Center the next day... More

437,"Stay here alot, kids go to school in Columbia and this hotel has become my home away from home."
438,staff was not friendly
439,"was just an overnite stay, was on a long trip and needed someplace to sleep for the nite. Got in at 9:30pm and left before 6am so was good for that. That was the plan and it worked."
440,Overall fine
441,It was a comfortable stay. I will say that the walls are a bit thin. I didn't like hearing slamming doors throughout the night from other guests. The room was fairly clean. The beds were really comfortable. Breakfast was decent. The front desk clerk could be a bit more friendlier. I would stay there again.
442,"When we first walked into our building, there was a skunky smell. Luckily, our room wasn't quite as bad. We did go across the street to the grocery store and got some air spray for our room. The pillows were not the best quality. The bedspread was thin. The mattress was nice, however. The shower had good water pressure."
443,Excellent
444,great stay and great accommodation on the hectic days of the Biennale opening. The ladies at the reception are very efficient and exquisite and are no less the girls serving breakfast. To go back

448,"Stayed for a weekend (Thurs-Mon) and thankfully the Tigers Football team was on the road so getting a room wasn't hard. It was a great value for the little cost of the room. If you're on a tight budget, this place is great. If you're looking for a resort stay and planning on spending your entire trip in the hotel, this is not your place. Bed was great to sleep in, shower was hot to bathe in. All I needed the room for."
449,Pretty good place to stay. Price is pretty low compared to others nearby and the rooms are pretty good. Wasn't there much because of work but had no problems when I was there. TGI Friday's next door is great.
450,This was a fantastic stay. The employees were great! Had a light bulb break and they came straight away and cleaned it up. Nice pillows. Close to a lot of eateries.
451,The cleaning staff left dirty towels in our room which we found when we checked into our room. The onsite clerk came to pick them up but did not apologize and was hesitant when we first asked her.
452,Second year staying here for True/False. The room is fine. Breakfast is better than a lot of other budget places.
453,"I booked the hotel last minute as I was simply too tired to continue driving. I'm in grad school so I needed cheap. Considering the price, the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected. The staff was friendly enough, the hotel smelled like mildew, serious updates were needed, and the continental breakfast was lacking. The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself. The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The pillows were hard and lumpy... like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didn't really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did. The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off, a noise would start (I'm assuming some kind of duct work) that sounded like someone was knocking at my door. This continued through the night so needless to say, I didn't sleep very well."
454,I would recommend this hotel to others. It was a nice facility nice room and accommodation.
455,"Hotel was clean, the kids had fun swimming and had a room closet to the pool. Breakfast was good."
456,"The room was clean, the hotel workers were very good and the breakfast was also good. But the kennel with the dogs was awful. These dogs starting barking at six in the morning. The television in my room was a twenty inch LG. I will never go back there again."
457,"Showed up on Friday left on Sunday. Everything was good. Breakfast was great. Very nice staff. The only problem was the bathroom. The toilet, shower head, and tub faucet were loose. It looks like they tried to update the tub area but didn't do a good job of it. The lights in the bathroom are exetremely hot. Other than that good trip."
458,Bed was very firm and uncomfortable TV speaker had a lot of static like it was busted remote didn't work very good and our key cards would not open the outside doors most of the time
459,"Clean room, good service, a decent breakfast bar. My only complaint is that the booking site said nothing about an additional 100.00 cash deposit (refundable) for those who pay cash. A very unpleasant surprise when we checked in."
460,i would been nice if we didn't get the wheelchair accessible. Bathroom is for wheelchair accessible not for family.
461,"Great just a suggestion: sheet between blanket so no touching blanket. When asked for extra blanket, i got a bedspread- they are so dirty should not be used in any hotel."
462,Clean. Great for a one nighter. Only bad part was the traffic at ruch hr.
463,"Looks nothing like the pictures on line, terrible hotel"
464,"The room and hotel were generally clean. Some areas of the parking lot were too dark for my liking, but there were more than enough spaces. About what you would expect for the price."
465,Was really close to show me games.
466,My daughter was moving into Mizzou so we went up the night before I made the reservations online I must say when I walked into the lobby of the hotel seem older but nice I then checked into my room went and got something to eat came back use the restroom to see two tiny bugs not sure what they were at this point I killed them and wanted to my room saw a roach crawling up my drink when I called the front desk I told the guy I have bugs in my room he said yes as if this were a regular occurrence and then took him about 15 minutes to get me moved to a different room to say the least I was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting
467,"Only .3 (three tenths!) of a mile away from the Kirby St. gate of NRG Stadium. It can even be considered walking distance, and you avoid the price of parking! How nice it is to be so nearby after attending an exciting event at NRG Stadium..... saving the possibly long drive home, or to the airport, for the next day."
468,This wae a single night stop during an extended trip.
469,"for pleasure, shopping and fun all was great very reasonable room rate"
470,"directly off hwy 70, lots of eateries like Fridays and cracker barrel at same exit"
471,Overall a very pleasant stay. Newer flat screen TV with a great variety of channels to pick from and the bed was very comfy. Plenty of parking and the staff were very friendly. I would gladly stay here again!
472,The stay was good except for the room not being cleaned before we checked in
473,"Convenient location right off the highway. Bed was comfortable, room was warm. Felt safe traveling alone. Hotel is a little outdated and worn around the edges, but you can tell they work to keep it clean."
474,Worst hotel stay I have had in years. Stains on sheets Noisy others staying in hotel Room made lots of noise from above Service was lacking at best.
475,"Hotel is in desperate need of remodeling! Carpet was dingy, bathtub was and bath fixtures were old. Door was loose, even when locked, safety issue. But Good location, close to the interstate."
476,Building security was an issue
477,Hotel was ok just about all the staff did a great job except the night shift desk cleark. Called my room at 4 am because he didn't know how to do something and after a few relized he called wrong room. Pluse peoples kid down the hall slammed there door all night long.
478,"On our two trips prior to this one both the breakfast and the internet were below par. I am glad to report that on our most recent trip the internet worked great and the breakfast was much improved. When you go to Texas for cancer treatment, the little things become big things. You can stay here with confidence."
479,"It was a nice room. pleasant to the eye. But the TV keep mess up. But I didn't complain, because we were out most of the day. I didn't know about it because I went to bed. My daughter told me about it the next day. The night stand was dirty. But rest of room looked clean. Towels were hard."
480,2nd stay. will stay again
481,"Workers, check in, and check out were great!! Grounds and rooms need be cleaner. Bad musty, wet smell when entering building."
482,Stewart was very helpful with check-in.
483,"They allow pets (dogs only) in this hotel, which is probably great for pet owners, but not so great when the dogs have accidents, and the hallway smells of doggy poo. It was cleaned up, but the smell did linger. Otherwise hotel was a good value for the price. And I would recommend to people who absolutely have to take their dogs with them while they travel."
484,Excellent
485,"The service, location and room were in line with the price. The hotel is dated but the service was friendly, room was clean."
486,Very in the middle of nowhere. Did not feel safe or clean. Walls very thin. Breakfast minimal
487,"Possibly the smokiest hotel room I've ever been in. Pulling the covers up would release yet another cloud of smoke an awful experience, for sure. To top it off, upon return home, everything in our bags, including the bags themselves required washing! Old and smoky."
488,Hotel is old but you get what you pay for. Price was one of the cheapest in the area but the hotel was pretty old you can't change that. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast wasn't great but typical. All staff was very nice.
489,Stayed here for two nights to visit MDA. The rooms are clean. The bed is comfortable. The internet worked great. The staff was nice. Close to many restaurants. I highly recommend. We stayed at Best Western the last visit and had a total different (bad) experience.
490,This hotel isn't bad for the price I paid. It is located in a great spot. Easy to get to.
491,Very affordable. Very clean room. Lobby and meeting rooms a little outdated. Breakfast area was clean and well stocked. Friendly staff. We needed a place before and after surgery. Meet our needs. We will stay again.
492,There were only a hand full of cars in the parking lot. But room was adequate although there was a fairly loud drone sound coming from the roof that I could hear not only in my room but also as I walked down the hall. I speculated that it was an HVAC unit on the roof. It was annoying but do -able so I didn't complain.
493,"The hotel is in a prime location. Close to the highway and easy to get to. Breakfast was OK, but lacked variety. Some eggs and more fruit options would have been nice. The other issue is how loud it was in the halls at night. Doors banging and people talking went right through the walls. Hard to get a good night sleep. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. I did have trouble accessing the WiFi. Overall it wasn't a bad stay but there were issues."
494,Enjoyed everything but that hard Ole soap.. not pleasant and too hard. Also only 1 washclothe.
495,"Everything was great. Only thing that disturbed me, was a notice on the desk in the room. Advising how to lock your car and what not to leave in it. That means to me, that there are a lot of car break-ins. But like I said, we didn't have a problem and a good experience."
496,"Stay was fine. Sneezed/coughed a bit my first night there, but seems to lessen the second night. Hotel looked great, but rooms are clean, but bathroom a little worn. Toilet is really low, but bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. Free breakfast, can be slightly more balance nutritionally, but it was okay."
497,I could not sleep. It was noisey from 2:40 An until 4:05 AM. The bathroom floors needed to be cleaned.
498,Managers were great. However maid service was lacking. Had to request service. When we did receive service it was poor. Also had to constantly get room key reprogramed.
499,Our room was musty and it stunk to high heaven. Do not recommend this place. The building was old and dirty. Bad experience
500,"I was a bit concerned after checking the rating of this hotel, but was so pleasantly surprised when I got there. I was basically there for a medical visit and it seemed like so were a lot of other people, but we would totally stay there if we were just visiting Houston. My mom checked in for me since I... More"
501,My friends and I enjoyed the hotel. The staff was helpful and got us set up with a nice taxi service. The room serves its purpose of a place to get ready for a concert and then come back late and get some good sleep before heading home.
502,great value quiet clean and comfortable
503,"This hotel is the best bang for your buck in Columbia. Great location, very clean, very nice staff and rooms are large and come with a microwave,fridge and coffee pot. It's older but redecroated rooms make it feel like home. I have 2 kids going to school in Columbia and when I come to visit I always check to see if this hotel has the best deal and it usually does. I stay here whenever I can, highly recommend for the price."
504,"I won't stay at a Howard Johnson again. Had to be moved to a different room cause the key card wouldn't work. Asked for a non smoking room and room used to be a smoking room. It smelled like an ash tray, bedding had burn holes in it. Staff was very nice and helpful but was a very nasty feeling in either room. The second room didn't smell like an ash tray but did have a weird funk to it. There were random hairs find in the room. The ac was having a hard time keeping up on a 75day. Key cards had to be redone multiple times. Shower curtain was thin so water got all over the floor. Pillows were the size of my hand. All in all not a relaxing stay."
505,It was fine. My only complaint (which is minor) is that the bathroom didn't have shampoo (and instead had two conditioner tubes).
506,It was fine for our purposes and we would stay there again.
507,"Friendly staff, clean room. Good breakfast."
508,"Older hotel but very clean, breakfast had good selection and attendant kept area clean. We would stay again"
509,Clean room and nice breakfast
510,"We selected the hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast. The breakfast was to be available beginning at 6:00 am. We went at 6:00, 6:20 and then again at 6:40. The room was dark and there was no food. We asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't come to prepare the food. We left. I can't recommend Howard Johnson to my friends, family or co-workers and I do not plan on using Howard Johnson again."
511,"We stay here each time my husband has a medical appt in Houston and they do offer medical rates if you ask. It is near medical center off of Main St. Very quiet and very clean large rooms. Several eating places within walking distance. Offers medical center shuttle also. The pool is very small, but we don't use that anyways... More"
512,"The hotel needs some updating, but it met our basic needs."
513,"We wanted a clean, decent, reasonably priced hotel for the night. This fit the bill."
514,"I just wanted somewhere to sleep for Thanks! night on a cross country trip and I got that. No frills... phone, clock radio and TV not working."
515,"Our room was very clean, the tub was surprisingly large. We had a quiet incident free evening, you can't ask for better than that!"
516,Room was not set up for 2 people only one towel and washcloth. No bathmat to step out on. Only stayed on way to wedding elsewhere.
517,We thought it was a great hotel for the price. Close to the university of Missouri. An older hotel that has been nicely updated. We go there to visit my son and we would certainly stay there again. Great for the money!
518,We stayed here for Family Weekend at Mizzou. Hotel was clean and suitable for our needs. Beds were comfortable and it quiet compared to other locations we have stayed at in the past. Parking was very good considering the number of people who attend this type of event. We would stay here again in the future.
519,"Decent place, somewhat dated, and a strange musty smell"
520,"Room needed updating, but for the price I could deal with that. What I couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and cobwebs covering the drapes that blows all over the room every time the air kicks on, or the toilet that isn't attached to the floor properly, or the drafty window, mildew stained tile, torn curtains, and cracked microwave door. I also wasn't expecting to spend all night smelling the food from the banquet rooms downstairs. I wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price I paid for this room, but I was at least expecting to have had them keep up with routine maintenance and cleaning, and maybe put in some air fresheners in the hallway to counteract the smells from the banquets. Overall, the bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and I only needed someplace for 1 night to attend a conference at the university, so it served it's purpose."
521,"It was a good hotel for that one night stay kind of a thing. Staff was great, bed was super nice, and location was perfect. It was just over used and cramped. It looked clean but did not feel clean. None smoking rooms smell like smoking rooms and burn marks in comforter."
522,Visited the comfort suites in new iberia louisiana and my daughters head was almost decapitated in the elivator. When i talked to the front desk to make a complaint and get the front desk to give me the corporate information she gave me a cell phone number instead of the corporate office . We called numerous times before an answer... More
523,Needs breakfast meets.
524,"This is by far the best cheap hotel in Columbia. It's clean, the rooms have refrigerators and there's no resident scary guests. Book early, on game weekends it sells out fast."
525,Just a stop over for the night.
526,"The only clean thing about this hotel was the check in. We paid (with tax) 155.00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact we have older kids and they refuse to sleep in the same bed (no biggie) when we got to our room for the night and turned down the bed the cover had several hairs in-bedded in the cover, the sheets had several cigarette burn holes in it. So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed. There was a dead bug under the counter that the coffee maker was on (coffee and no cups) the outlet by the coffee maker when we went to plug in the straighter it would just fall out, the outlet behind the nightstand was literally hanging out of the wall. The little doily that I'm assuming should have been on the table under the phone was behind the table and on the floor, I'm sure was there for some time... I totally understand a quick cheap place to stay but, when you are up all night worrying about if the place is going to burn down!! NO THANKS! I'm glad our room was at the end of the hall by the EXIT door. You will not find my family there. I did speak to a manager (I'm assuming since he said he could hear out my issues) and he gave me a whopping 20 off so instead of 155 I am paying 124.00 not satisfied and will not return. Who pays even 124.00 to stay in a place like this!! HJ 1 myself 0..I lost on this bad decision making. I wish I could get the picture to upload. I forgot about the stains on the comforter (the same bed that had hair and cigarette burns on it."
527,The motel was clean and comfortable bed and a good location. People were courteous had a nice breakfast complementary.
528,Husband and I stayed one night there we like the room and people that worked there were nice plane on going back wish we could of staying the hole weekend. Hotel has pool. Stores close by if u like to go shopping and restaurants
529,After driving 7-1/2 hours I really needed to stop. This place looked cute. Upon entering the lobby was clean and quaint. The prices were very reasonable (65 vs 120 at bigger name brand hotels). I got into my room and it was clean and large. The only negative I could find was the room smelled very musty. Perhaps because it... More
530,"Our room was clean and spacious, right next to the pool on the outside edge, and even included a mini-fridge. We didn't get a chance to have breakfast either day, but the fact that it is offered is nice. Super close to everything, within 10-15 minutes from most attractions/restaurants we wanted to visit. Also, the staff was very friendly when... More"
531,The motel is older (still using keys) the room was clean and the beds comfortable. they do need to make some improvements. Carpet was water damaged at the door and then there was fiber missing over by the bathroom. a couple of brown spots on the ceiling from what I would assume was a room leak. the front of the... More
532,"room size was good, bathroom could have been cleaner, there was hair on the floor and walls of the shower.carpet had wet spots on it all over the room. WiFi did not work, poor signal. The bed was average, okay for 1 night."
533,"I have been staying here, off and on, four about 7 years. The first time was when my father was going thru treatment at MD Anderson. The staff were great, made accommodations for him and also for his caregivers. They were also very understanding for those going thru treatments also local hospitals. I have also stayed there during my pre... More"
534,"The desk clerk was kind and friendly. The room had a, strong musty odor, but appeared clean. The pancakes weren't very good. Biscuits and gravy were typical for hotel chains. There was no honey, nor cream cheese. They did have bananas and the pastries looked pretty good. The amount of food choices available was pretty limited compared to most average... More"
535,"We stayed their one night on our way to tunica ms. Its located next to a large strip mall in osage beach. We stayed in a regular room,but they offer theme rooms as well. We did have a problem with the tv remote,but the lady at the front desk was very nice and curtious,and tried to do another remote but did not work,Come... More"
536,"We were able to try out a different suite from our last visit. A hot tub is well worth the extra cost, especially after riding 3 hours on a motorcycle. Room was clean, pool area was nice and surprisingly still open after Labor Day. The free breakfast was ok. We only tried it once during our stay though. Love the... More"
537,I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Nice clean comfortable rooms and the most friendly accommodating staff. Location is literally next to the Outlet Malls and close to everything. Can't wait to go back!
538,"Nothing spectacular. Room was very clean. Like most hotels/motels at the Lake, this one could definitely use some updating. There was nothing wrong necessarily, but the decor was very strange. Fake Roman columns in front of the jacuzzi with fake vines running over the top. Lots of wasted space in the room. Plenty of room for a comfortable chair or... More"
539,Room was clean. Close to shopping. Staff very nice was easy to get in and out We would stay again Was very happy with. Our stay we did not try the breakfast but there was a lot of people in there eating. When we went by
540,"Comfortable bed with crisp sheets and a luxury blanket (not the cheap Polly kind), room smells good, very clean, affordable price, easy to find, plenty of parking, shopping right next door, close to the lake - OVI will continue be our go to place whenever we visit Lake of the Ozarks."
541,"Was very pleased with this hotel. Friendly front desk staff, clean room and very best location. Was nice for couples weekend, and will return with our family. Walking distance of outlet mall and shopping across the highway."
542,"Our room was a double queen bed accommodation it was very clean and everything worked it had a refrigerator, flat screen T.V. with cable hair dryer and the usual shampoo and soap, etc. My husband wasn't too impressed with the complimentary breakfast bar, but it was okay. We received several good restaurant recommendations from the owner and had a good... More"
543,"My wife and I stayed there on Thursday, May 26th, for the very first time. We were pleasantly surprised at this place as it proved to be almost everything they had advertised. Our check-in was easily done and the room assignment was fine with the exception we did have to climb a flight of stairs with luggage to get to... More"
544,"Very nice, like new lobby and rooms. Lobby and halls have tile floors that look great. Fancy, large chandelier in lobby. Hotel is 13 years old but looked like it was remodeled recently. Near Rice University. Had a security guard on duty. Fridge in our room was noisy. Dual phone charger ports by bed and on desk. Lots of digital... More"
545,Stay July 28-31st for a family reunion only have a few complaints. When we got to our room the key lock was jammed called front desk she tried to explain how to jiggle it right so it would open. I didn't know it would take 20 minutes to get the door opened each time but whatever.... The door eventually opened...... More
546,"The hotel itself was not the best, the owners were friendly."
547,"While attempting to check out of the room a night early, the manager decided to come out to the parking lot and yell at our group. Won't be staying there again."
548,Not far for my purpose. Good place to sleep and change. Needs a little improvement when it comes to cleaning a little vacuum not bad daily. We had what we needed cannot complain. Nice people.
549,"The photo listing on this website is very deceiving. This motel is dirty and the pictures do not show a true representation of the rooms. The bed linens, as well as the bath towels had black, dirty stains. I would NEVER stay here again!"
550,"Terrible water pressure, loose toilet seat, microwave cord was not long enough to reach an outlet and NO SMOKE DETECTOR in room!"
551,"This hotel was horrible. The service was horrible, the cleaning crew wore regular street clothes and when they came to my room banging on the door at 11:03am that check out was 11am. I was scared, couldn't tell who they were considering the hotel was in a seedy part of town, next to a truck stop. I asked her (cleaning lady) to identify herself and then she came back with two others who couldn't speak English. Even tho I had another night's reservation, they failed to confirm/check. I asked for towels and was told by owner it's a even exchange towel system. Give old towels to get new ones..... wow The bathroom was disgusting, shower curtain hadn't been changed since the place was originally purchased. I could go on on on but I'm sure u get my point. If I wasn't in a desperate situation from last minute planning to attend the UK vs USC game in South Carolina and every hotel in the city booked. I would have never ever stayed at that Super 8 hotel."
552,"Stayed here for a family visit. Got the job done, at a good price. But not a well-maintaind room. Basic cheap hotel room."
553,Room has a odor to it
554,"Staff was very nice. The outside appearance is nice. Inside my feet and socks literally turned black from dirty carpet. The Lights, phone, and corners had mold. No pool, coiffed maker broken, half the outlets plugs fell out and a towel had mold on it. I couldn't switch hotels cause area was booked for military graduation."
555,"Gnstiger starting point for Venice visits. Quiet location on the Lido. Lido airfield and boat moorings are within full reach. Rooms quite cramped, but everything is available. Frhstck for Italy extremely rich. Hotel was supposed to regularly sing a chamber yer, as an infestation with bedbugs could be detected."
556,"The hotel was great, staff was great only bad thing was the breakfast as I am a choice hotel guy and most of the comfort suites have a great breakfast this one kinda lacked. But Staff and rest of the hotel was great"
557,the woman has flipped out didn't realize that I had paid through all my stuff in the parking lot by contact was stolen a couple of the items were stolen it will crack them all over the place tons of illegal activity I feared for my life I will never stay there again I beg you not ever stay there if you are single female I was propositioned about 16x it could even walk out of my room I had a layover for 14 hours at the only reason I picked that hotel is it was 1 mile away I cannot believe they stole things from my suitcase and do all my things in the parking lot he did not know that I had booked another day if you guys get off the property get off the property I called the cops I file charges it was the worst experience of my life she did the same thing to another man he threw coffee in her face she got hit its just it was a hole that experience I cannot believe they stole my things out of my suitcase unbelievable
558,"I was really impressed by this Super 8 motel and would recommend it for anybody wanting to or having to be in Columbia, SC."
559,Room was infested with cockroaches
560,"The two rooms given to us did not have running water so the crews were given other rooms but then a lady came yelling at them to get out, when they presented her with the new keys she told them if they did not leave she would call the police. When I tried to get a refund SAM, the mgr said no, they left because they wanted to. We will not refund anything. NOT using them again!"
561,The Breakfast was very good. The host showed us how to use the waffle machine. They also had a good cereal selection. He was very friendly. Location was good to get on the highway to visit fort Jackson. The room was very affordable and clean. I was disappointment no one came to clean the room on the 2nd day. The bed sheet had a large spot of what appeared to be an un-washable cooking grease.
562,"We walked into the lobby and there was stuff all over the place. They set up a folding sight screen to hide their bird and other personal stuff. The motel was a bit creepy. I used one of my shirts to cover the pillow because the place was dirty and not sure I wanted to put my head on their pillow. Had nowhere else to go, otherwise I would have."
563,Glad I only stayed for a few hours. I didn't feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone.
564,Glad I only stayed for a few hours. I didn't feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone.
565,"The hotel was very mediocre - even less than what you would expect from a Super 8. Also, upon check-in, they assessed me an extra 15.00 fee for my dog even though that fee was not disclosed on Hotels.com or the Super 8 hotel interconnect on Policies that is part of the Hotels.com website. Thus the hotel stay turned out to be an 80. a night deal which is more than the amount a rational person would want to pay to stay at a Super 8."
566,"I am very disappointed that the janitor took my personal face cloth and the bath tub drain looked like a scorpion and there was dust on the bathroom wall,air conditioner,and furniture and most importantly just because I booked my room through 3rd party they did not give me a receipt which is not"
567,We stayed here because of a family medical emergency. Did not have any options for a room. We had the SMALL queen room--think it may have been laundry area previously. Bed fair. Room quite. Was OK for one night. This hotel is near the stadium. Price was ok .99 plus tax.
568,"I wanted a cheap hotel while traveling and found this motel. Although cheap, I was still disappointed especially since it still reeked of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking. Also, the walls were paper thin which was not cool. But, it was a cheap bed for the night, so that's what counts."
569,The hotel stay was alright. I will not stay at the location again.

572,"The Hotel was perfect and the food was excellent, close to the beach, 5 kind of restaurant, the Hotel staff is very friendly,"
573,"I'ts a nice medium size hotel on the beach. With two stories buildings and a few pools spread out. The best part was definitely the staff They truly seem to enjoy their jobs and that makes all the difference. We stayed for four days and had a great, relaxing time. We went as a couple, but could come back with our children: There's a kid's club and some of the rooms have direct access -right of the back door- to a canal system that connect to one pool. If you walk down the beach, five minutes away, you will end crossing a nude beach/hotel. If you have a problem seeing naked people enjoying the sun, walk the other side (to the docks)"
574,"The resort was beautiful, well kept, and the room was luxurious without being opulent. We upgraded to a swim up room, which was fun for my 10 year old. Every restaurant was great, and so was the room service food. Lots of places to swim, either at the resort or the beach. The staff was consistently friendly and courteous. They had inexpensive activities like paddle boarding and kayaking available, of which we took advantage. My only complaint would be that I had trouble with the Wifi, which I paid to have unlimited access to, but it seemed spotty and inconsistent. Otherwise everything about the resort was lovely, including our giant bathtub. I would happily stay here again, with or without my little one."
575,Very positive experience. Could have not ask for a nicer facility with great amenities. Everyone was very nice and recommend for families for sure.
576,First class.
577,"nice hotel, lots of accommodations for children. Snorkeling was great! 24 he room service was nice too! Spa was amazing!!"

579,"The food was great, the service was very inconsistent. Staff are generally very nice and friendly but often got orders wrong, forgot about requests or got us completely different items. This was a challenge given we were traveling with an infant. The front desk staff and concierge services were inconsistent and inflexible as well."
580,"The positives: Awesome lobby and checkin., resturants above average and 5 to choose from/ room service all hours/ beach is lovely and close/ very clean resort /close to cancun airport./ reasonable workout area Negatives: - staff always seems to be angling for a tip/ the cabana boy mafia controls all the ebacj spots and you have to play their tip game to get a spot/ clothing optional swingers beach is next resort down the beach/ no shuttles to airport or cars to rent to drive to nearby puerto morelos/ way too many kids and children over spring break. Not 1 16-18 year old boy for my daughter to socialize with./ expesive wi fi is not part of all inclusive"
581,"The front desk and management we dealt we were very poor. Every simple request required multiple phone calls, and they placed us in a room directly across from daily construction which lasted past 8pm on two occasions, even though we had an infant with us who needed to nap and go to bed early at night. When we asked a manager if we could change rooms, she declined and told us it would end at 5pm that day and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip. It lasted two more full days, and she conveniently had the next day off so we could not address it with her. Also, the check-in process was awful as they made us wait three hours in the hot and humid conditions for our room. However, the restaurants (and their staff) are excellent. I can't say enough about the staff at Blue, as they were extremely friendly and always went out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face. The food at all three dinner restaurants (as well as Chil for lunch) was very good, and service was mostly great throughout. Our room itself was very clean, and the pool areas are fantastic. Also, room service was very fast and was also delicious. It was a shame that the front desk dropped the ball on so many occasions because it really could have been an awesome trip, but it was unfortunately blemished by poor customer service on the front end."

584,The food was excellent
585,"The Hotel is nice and the staff very friendly,the beach is very close to the rooms and is very good for families however they have many opportunities to improve. The beach cabanas must be booked the day before and we were not notified when we arrived at the hotel, although it is sold as Gourmet All Inclusive, the food is not really gourmet and the options are limited. They offer drinks and food service on the beach and it does exist, but the person in charge passes by the beach every hour. They do not have transfer service areopuerto-hotel-airport, you have to hire it separately and the hotel does not recommend to anyone specific. It seems to be a little atipic, but there were too many algae at sea, the good thing is that they had hired staff to clean the beach all the time, but it's definitely not enough. The feeding possibilities for babies are very limited and although requests can indeed be made to the chef, the service is very delayed."
586,"We traveled with our 10 mnaders baby and were very happy with Azul Beach. The service was over the question and the staff were extremely helpful and sweet to us and our daughter. B.la they bid for more erstification when vr ran out and cooked special food for her. The hotel also suits those who do not have children and we liked the mixture of gster. We had never before been on an all-inclusive and a ventyr was not. You live no ifthe Maya Riviera's many excursions and even though we had a car, there was nothing to kra. Sure, we were happy that it was not lg in Cancun's hotel zone but after a while the hotel area was small. Even so, we can really get back to the quiet, bekvma and child-friendly!"
587,Charming hotel. Good food for an all inclusive. Great for kids.
588,"Beautiful hotel with a Kids Club but still maintains that exclusive feel. Staff goes out if their way to please you. All inclusive implies programming, but trust me, they customize things to please their guests. Wonderful food and wine. One of my best hotel experiences ever."

590,"We made our reservations a month in advance, my wife called on the day we are suppose to check in, gets the run around of whether or not they will have a room or not! Who runs a business like this When they found a room we were given a couple cards, neither of which opened the door. Overall, you have no feeling of security, even if you are parked next to your room i was constantly checking outside on my vehicle."
591,"Attention do not stay here for any reason! If there's no hotels available you'd be better off staying in your vehicle showering a truck stop! They treat their customers like crap, walk in your room w/out permission(waiting for you say anything), try to rush you out the rooms w/the doors open customers aren't dressed. If you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay 25 to get it out won't give you a shuttle ride anywhere until you do. The showers are cold. I told the van driver just a minute after she knocked she swung the door open claiming she didn't hear me. I told her I needed to get dressed she snatched the door open againx2 the curtains while I was getting ready. Don't under any circumstance stay here pleaseyou'll regret it!

594,"Hotel was off the strip, but close to a shortcut to downtown -made it easier to avoid some of the traffic. When I was checking in, lady had a meeting or something to get to, so I felt like I was inconveniencing her. Her replacement was ok, not really friendly, but not rude. Staff was better the next day."
595,"This Days Inn is located off the Strip which is what we wanted. It was still just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in Branson. The breakfast included waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy as well as cold cereals and oatmeal. The property is on a steep hill, so park closer to the street and use the stairs closer to the front so you'll have fewer flights of stairs to climb. The only complaint we had was that our room's carpet was dirty, evidently from what the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with. We would stay here again though."
596,We stayed recently just to take our kids to Silver Dollar City. This is a motel and it is very noisy until at least 11:00 PM. The rooms are fine enough. Breakfast is a scrum of 15-25 people trying to get at the food while you are dodging small children. There are a lot of kids so don't stay if you aren't into the kid scene.
597,Very helpful staff
598,It was just ok. Would try to stay some where else next time.
599,"Clean and comfortable, nice hotel for its price range, good location--we enjoyed our 2-night stay. FYI, the outdoor pool is open until 11 p.m. poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls, but if you have toddlers/young children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party, you may want to request a room on another side of the hotel--pool party noise kept us up late the first night (and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we weren't worn out from traveling!) Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!) Overall, our three-room party of extended family had a good experience, and would stay again."
600,"The room was fine and the mattress was very comfortable. Unfortunately, I arrived while the front entrance was under-construction. There was not sufficient signage to find out how to enter the building. I would have left, had I not already had a reservation through Hotels.com."
601,My family enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and the price definitely made it worthwhile. We would stay here again.
602,Staff helpful and informative- room clean. Kids enjoy the pool area.
603,A great place to stay. Great people there.
604,"This hotel was rented for a couple on vacation from Illinois. We are a young couple so money is tight. This hotel was decent and the price could not be beat. The room was a little dirty (like the floor, for example) but I expected it. I do have a few things to caution you of: -The continental breakfast is less than stellar, but it gets the job done -Rooms by the pool are loud"
605,The hotel was very clean and well kept during our stay there. The pool was a decent size and very clean. The breakfast left a little to be desired. Overall for the price it was great. I would stay there again.
606,I was very disappointed. The reservation was messed up when I got there and they had charged my card instead of letting me pay cash as first agreed on. And then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though I had not requested it and I had to do my own calling to get problem corrected and I am still not sure it is fixed. Very unhappy with all of it. Room not comfortable. Spider was in my towel. And it did not help to have a room for someone with walking handicap because I had to walk up an incline on the driveway to get to my room. I will never use hotels.com again nor will I ever stay at this motel again. Ever!!!
607,room was clean breakfast was good stayed 4 days same breakfast every day was good away from attractions which was good no traffic but couldnt walk to anything which was bad but was in central location so it was easy to drive to
608,"The staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms were clean, but the beds weren't all that comfortable. The pool was small but clean. I will stay again if we ever go back."
609,"For starters, hotel staff was great. Very pleasant. However, upon entering the room, I discovered that it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was a bit dated. When I woke the next morning, I could see sunshine coming through the edges of the door. While I wasn't concerned for my safety, I did wonder how many bugs were coming to visit me during the night!!"
610,"have stayed there before.... Clean, continental breakfast is a continental breakfast..... quiet. and easy to get in and out of. Beginning to need some make over from the amount of traffice it serves....."
611,Reprehensible three days without maid service despite telling the management after it had happened the first time. I would not recommend this hotel for this reason.
612,"Very enjoyable stay. Room very clean and comfortable, staff were very accommodating, excellent breakfast ."
613,"The stay at this hotel was a good experience for me and our entourage. Room was decent and in a quiet area. Staff was good, but the hotel needs to better improve their handicapped parking area near the main entrance."
614,Older hotel that could use some refreshing. Initial room smelled of cat urine. Comforter was old and tattered. Sitting chairs were stained. Staff was helpful. Moved to another room w/o incident. Overall satisfaction was fair. For a few dollars more could get something nicer. Breakfast was very good.
615,"Great price thru Hotels.com, manager could not believe the rate. Not on the strip, convenient access to Hwy 76, Shows Silver Dollar City. Breakfast was better than most motel breakfasts."
616,Hot breakfast was great! Staff pleasant and accommodating. Great location with new restaurant next door. Outdoor pool was clean. Free Wi-Fi was hit with the kids. Would stay there again.
617,"Affordable place to stay. Coffee pot in room, fridge clean but a little outdated"
618,"It has been years since I've stayed in a Day's inn but based on the rate and location I decided to go ahead and book my room there. I was very pleasantly surprised. I expected a very basic motel and was surprised at the spaciousness and quality of the room and extra perks, eg. breakfast, refrig. etc. I will certainly consider staying at a Days Inn again."
619,"Managet talked over us and wouldnt listen 2 us. Put us n wrong room. Bed was a bowl and killed our back and hips. 2nd room ac didnt work right, bathroom door didnt shut all the way, bathroom vent sounded like a freight train, could hear vents n other rooms."
620,Very nice and Drafts Pub Grille just opened next door. Very handy.
621,Nice hotel for the price. The staff was very friendly with a great attitude. The only bad thing I can say about my stay was the fitted sheets for the king size bed didn't fit and I had to keep waking up to put them back on
622,"The pictures on the web site were more expensive looking then the reality. We were told we had one of the best rooms, besides staring at cargo containers, the TV would not work so they changed our room. It was not well furnished and we could not regulate the air conditioner (way too warm for sleeping). The continental breakfast was good and the staff was very nice and helpful. The linens were harsh and uncomfortable. Sorry, but this was not at all what I expected and it was certainly unacceptable."
623,"This hotel was great. Nice area, clean, and close to strip and outlet stores. Only negative was the the shower head needed to be a foot higher. Im 6ft and I had a hard time washing my hair. Any taller than 5'7, you will have some trouble showering here. Other than that, I would of given this hotel a 5 but I would stay here again."
624,It was a good stay. Didn't stay in room much for all the shopping and Silver Dollar City. Was so glad they have football channels so we could was our team win. This is the first hotel that the refrigerator kept our drinks and food cold. Sink water was hard to turn on and then it would spray water on you. Would stay there again.
625,"We had a great stay. I definitely appreciated having the a/c cranked up when I walked into the room, especially since it was 100 that day! Room was comfortable and decent rate. Thanks!"
626,Front desk was friendly and helpful! Discovered a waterfall hiking trail around the corner where we could walk dogs. Great biscuits and gravy breakfast!
627,1 of the queen beds was broken in room. Very uncomfortable sleep that night.
628,The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast food was more than I expected. Everything was great.
629,It was way to loud and no way we could have got into the pool. If I was you I would never go without shoes in the room the carpet was so nasty. And the rooms seem very dark.
630,Everything about this hotel was great. It was convenient to many activities. Good free breakfast selection. We did not have an opportunity to use the pool because of the weather.
631,My wife and I stayed here recently on our first visit to Branson. The room was clean and updated. The breakfast in the morning was ample and lots of variety. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We booked a show through the hotel at the tribute theater that was a hoot. I would definitely stay here again. Would be a good central location if I was staying with my whole family also. Lots to do in the area.
632,"We thought the hotel was a little tired looking. Drawer handles on the dresser were loose, things like that. The breakfast was the same every day would have liked a little more variety. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The maid service was not very thorough at times, i.e. pulling the sheet up and tucking it in without making sure the mattress pad was in place."
633,The didn't tell me they were gonna run my credit card for accidental for a 100 charge. They just told me they had to double check my ID and the credit card that was used.
634,All facilities including Swimming Pool are very clean. Staff are very friendly. Hotel is centrally located. Great Value for Money.
635,"Hotel is in bad need of repair. Room was old, sink had damage, trim falling apart in bathroom , shower curtain bar so loose, shower curtain was at my feet, yuck. Bed ancient with icky old bed spreads. Should be put in one star category. The staff was the best part of this place."
636,Decent. Good location. Made it easy to get around Branson.
637,"The staff were very friendly and courteous,room were clean and the facilities in the hotel good. The continental breakfast has a wide range of choices."
638,"The Hotel was a little dated but still in pretty good condition. The breakfast was outstanding and had a great selection. The eating area was a little small for the crowd that came to breakfast, it just shows how good it was. I would stay here again and I will recommend it to friends and family."
639,The room was simple for the trip but didn't like the fact that the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard
640,"Let's start with the positives. Great location to everything and the staff were super friendly. Now the negatives. Dated and a bit worn, not to my liking and certainly not to my wive and kids either. There were bugs in the room. The kind that fly and some in the bed. We were very displeased and embarrassed. I will not return."
641,"There was a mix-up with Hotel.com, but the hotel staff connected with Hotel.com and both businesses worked it out for us. We highly appreciated that. We were given a room close to Lobby and over the pool, so it was a rather noisy room, but very convenient for our needs. The hotel couldn't help that the volley ball team yelled and ran up down stairs balconies. Just what one has to put up with during the busiest tourist season. However, with the help of the continuous running fan, the wonderful soft bed pillows being so tired, we rested very well. Breakfast was good had something for the diabetic diet, but super crowded. Probably half the folks had to take breakfast back to their rooms."
642,"We rented 2 rooms with double beds, in both rooms the beds were very worn out. NOT COMFORTABLE."
643,"I went to Branson for 4th of July so there were VERY few affordable options as every hotel raised it's prices. I paid close to double the price of what this hotel normally goes for. So I was already paying more than I should (beds and pillows were very uncomfortable) and on top of it, they have a ridiculous pet policy. 10 extra per night is not bad - it's the mandatory 50 cleaning fee whether the animal makes a mess or not. Paid way more than I should for an establishment that did not earn that value."
644,I stayed here with some girlfriends for a wine tasting getaway. The staff pointed out some great wineries and restaurants and were very friendly.
645,"Nothing fancy but met our needs. Quiet, convient and staff very friendly and helpful. Beds were very comfortable."
646,none
647,Our room was not ready until an hour and a half after check in. Then when we went to check out the next morning I waited 5 minutes or so before anyone came to the desk to check me out.
648,Price was a deal. Serving the breakfast saved us a lot of money. The family enjoyed their stay.
649,"Not deluxe but clean and quiet with friendly, competent staff. Good value."
650,Everyone was very friendly. Breakfast area a little crowded. Overall a good stay.
651,"Clean room, good breakfast, easy access."
652,Stay was very enjoyable. Hotel staff was friendly and always busy. We will definitely considering booking another stay when in the area.
653,Hotel was ideally located for a stay in Branson. Close enough to the action without the hassel of the traffic conjestion. Room was clean and comfortable.
654,Have stayed at this motel several times - highly recommend it. Front desk very friendly and helpful. The rest of the staff were very pleasant. The hot full breakfast was beyond words.
655,"Beautiful hotel. Very clean and service was great. This is a must stay and if I'm in need of a hotel in the Livermore area, this is the place to stay."
656,"Stayed here before, will always stay here!"
657,"We stayed here for Luther Family weekend in September. We could not get a hotel in Decorah Iowa and this was the next closest place. It is a small hotel with a small parking lot. Friday night when we checked in we were greeted and given our key, and it is literally a key not the credit card looking keys... More"
658,"I stayed here because I had a family wedding to attend. It definitely had a country feel with quilts and flannel linens. The motel was very clean, and felt comfortable. My room had a microwave and refrigerator. The wi-fi was slow, but usable. I would stay here again."
659,"Stayed here for Parents' Weekend at Luther College in Decorah. Other accommodations were full in town, and this is about 20 minutes away. The motel is a basic older motel. We've stayed here once before, and found it clean, so returned. This time I was less entranced. There are two buildings and we were in a different building this time... More"
660,"The place was easy to find, right on the main drag. Within walking distance to the shopping downtown. The room was clean, had all the amenities, blowdryer, fridge, microwave, clothes iron, coffee maker. Very slightly shabby but homey. Price was affordable. I would stay there again."
661,"We checked into our hotel on a busy Friday night, in this quaint little hotel. We have stayed here several times before and always are reassured that we will have another beautiful weekend, with very comfortable accommodations. The hotel is only about 20 minutes from the college, located in the small town of Harmony. The same family has owned the... More"
662,We stayed here while touring around SE Minnesota. It was a great place to stay and visit some of the sites in the area. The motel is very clean and the room was large with a very comfortable bed. The owners were very helpful with ideas on what to see and how to get there. On Saturday there were Amish... More
663,"Harmony was a good location for me, but other reviews of this motel made me reluctant to try it. Very glad I did. It looks like a chain hotel, right on main highway. Phone was answered on first try to make a reservation. Very friendly staff. Efficient check in. Helpful with directions to trail head. Room 103 was clean and... More"
664,"Very conveniently located, but I wasn't impressed. Had a chance to meet both owners, and they were friendly, but person who was working the desk when we checked in was a bit aloof and cool. Room was old, and the fan/light in the ceiling was shaking so badly that I thought it would fall down on us, so I turned... More"
665,"This summer, we brought our kids to visit the Amish village near the hotel before school started. We chose the Country Lodge Inn for our stay, which was a pleasant experience for us. Friendly, clean, and very comfortable place to stay. Definitely would choose to come again."
666,Pleasant 10 min walk along the sea front to the Water Bus. restaurants etc. Hotel was comfortable breakfast was good - quite a variety. Room aircon didn't work very well. Take mosquito repelant!
667,"The lido is perfect for a few days of tranquillity and relaxation, skn beach, lkkert omrde and small cozy family hotel with a sdt staff"
668,thisplace is beautiful.
669,"The room was big and the hotel staff were nice, but I couldn't get over the smelly linens. When I lay down on the bed, all I could smell was dirty old sweat socks! I don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens! They were that horrible! I had to spray the linens with perfume so I wouldn't smell them 'au naturel' while I'm sleeping! I'm never going to stay in this hotel ever again!"

We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was classically decorated to a very high standard and had a four poster king bed. The kitchen was very well equipped and included full size fridge, microwave and hob. The range of utensils was... More"
674,"This is the perfect place to stay if you are planning for more than a couple of days stay in Boston. The rooms at Inn at St Botolph's are more like cute little apartments than hotel rooms. The decor is funky/eclectic and the space, while compact, is utilized well. I like that I am not paying for things I don't... More"
675,"The rooms are clean and the owners are friendly. It feels like your own home. The hotel is in the middle of many scenic areas.

679,"This was a trendy boutique hotel right in the city. But because it was one block off the main road, it seems like the burbs... very quiet. Super friendly when asking questions before booking and really like the modern room furnishing. And so convenient to my meetings downtown. And great sushi across the street!"
680,"Nice place no complaints, one thing they didn't tell me,is they put a 100 hold on your card that stays for a couple days after you check out. I know this is not rare but any place that does has told me. I ended up calling trying to get it refunded. The breakfast in morning was pretty good, they had a full buffet not just some pakage pastries. Leave your swimsuit at home though the pool is small very small."
681,"This really felt like home from home. The location is very convenient, near to the T Green Line. The area is full of atmospheric, residential streets and there is the Prudential Center for shops and services. We had a comfortable suite with excellent Wi-Fi included. The set-up is different in that you pay in full on booking (which did worry... More"
682,"The staff was impressively thoughtful and accommodating. The room had great natural light, lots of space, quiet surroundings and a full kitchen - stove top, refrigerator, toaster, microwave, etc. The kitchen allowed us to not over eat at so many of Boston's fine restaurants and bring leftovers home for in-between meals or snacks. The location was excellent and it's a... More"

I like this place, and will come choose again when I go... More"
687,"We had a wonderful stay in the studio room. Comfortable, convenient and the self-serve breakfast was ideal. This boutique-sized inn also has an excellent location in a beautiful residential street and just short blocks from the Prudential building and shopping galore. We'll stay there again when in Boston."
688,"I stayed at this hotel on a last minute Boston getaway and found it clean, spacious and very conveniently located.

I just looked at my credit card bill... More"

Apartment has been renovated and at the front top room, is very sunny and pleasant. it was one of the larger rooms. However, the sound proofing was not good and we could hear people in the room next door, and... More"
691,Great stay for our night downtown Livermore at Bankhead Theater concert. Birthday celebration for friend. The most comfortable bed ever! Nice patio where we spent our morning catching up. Hotel under construction did not bother us.
692,This small apartment style accommodation is very nicely placed on historic St Botolph Street but close to the modern city. It's rooms are well equipped and comfortable with facilities for self service meals and food storage. Ideal for our three day Boston visit.
693,"Lots if good things to say about this boutique hotel - plus a few grumbles and one major gripe. Great location, very central but on a quiet street, near Copley, Back Bay and the South End, with excellent transport links. Nicely designed and well equipped suites (but see below). Good lighting and even a proper makeup mirror - thank you... More"
694,What Happened to this Place!!!! I come this hotel 8-12 times a year and know it well. They did major updates to a property that looked good already. The place feels super-clean and fresh. The front desk staff is always friendly. I really enjoy staying here.
695,"Budget-minded travelers appreciate amenities like complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy. In ShortSince its 1952 debut in Memphis, Tenn., Holiday Inn has become one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world. In addition to the Kids Eat and Stay Free program, Holiday Inn Express offers amenities like free high-speed Internet access, in-room data ports and cable television. Upgraded showers feature multi-function shower heads, curved curtain rods and upscale bath products. A complimentary breakfast bar is available with warm cinnamon rolls and 100-percent Arabica coffee."
696,We got there and our room wasn't ready for us yet. We were switched to another room and upon inspection of that room we found hair and stains all over the bed. We were then switched to another room that was set for someone with handicap accessibility which is fine but after inquiring about our original room we find out that that room has now been given to someone else. After all the inconvenience there're was no compensation what so ever. Would not give his a recommendation for anyone.
697,"The Inn at St. Botolph was the perfect spot for a surprise staycation I planned for my husband! We live in Boston but wanted to experience a different neighborhood!

701,SEE MY NOTE ABOVE
702,Perfect for my family to relax for the Easter weekend and for my girlfriend's Livermore 1/2 marathon!
703,We had a pet-friendly room and it was actually clean! Great place to stay.
704,Staff was friendly. Hotel room was comfortable. Carpet and tub need replacing. Road is being worked on so getting into the parking lot is annoying..... figuring out which cones to sneak through.
705,"had reserved 2 Queen beds with sleeper sofa. When I got to the hotel around checkin time, the room given me was 2 Queen with NO sleeper sofa... just a chair in a large room. There was a HUGE stain on the floor in front of the small refrigerator and peeling paint on walls/ceiling of bathroom. The refrigerator was in BAD NEED of defrosting. It looked like the Room 202 that I was given was a last resort room since it had dirty walls/carpet and peeling paint. I paid 139 per night for this room and feel that I was robbed. I asked another guest if their room was clean and they said YES however my room was NOT."
706,This hotel is just ok not at all a 4 star hotel furniture is old and needs replaced and could be alot cleaner. A 3 star hotel at best.
707,Close to restaraunts and only 5 mi Utes to the beach. Pool was very clean . Will return next year.
708,"they ran out of shampoo, and their door key maker was busted. they didnt offer any concessions for the inconvenience."
709,Clean front and side entryways. I loved the room size with a couch!
710,The only problem we had was that the key machine wasn't working so every time we wanted to go back to our room we had to escorted and wait for someone to do so or which was very irritating while on our honeymoon!!!!!!
711,"Just a short drive away from the cute beach town. This hotel was no frills, but the room was comfortable and clean and all that we needed."
712,"convenient location, good staff, nice room, quiet, adequate breakfast"
713,"The hotel was great. There was little construction going on which altered where they served breakfast, but it didn't bother us any."
714,"Clean, comfortable room. Staff was friendly and helpful. Starting breakfast earlier (6am instead of 6:30 or 7am) would be nice for the early riser. Construction on the road in front taking place, getting into and out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times."
715,Ecellent and fiendly staff.all very positive including full breakfast.
716,"This is a nice hotel. The road construction makes it fairly dangerous to get in to but once in the parking lot, it is it OK. While we were very impressed with everyone and everything during our first two days we were absolutely disgusted on Sunday. We left our room early Sunday and returned that evening to find our room had been left open ALL DAY - with dirty towels stacked in front of our door to keep it open and the bed left unmade - and ALL of our personal items (computers, phones, etc.) left out for anyone and everyone to peruse. And after being made aware we were still charged full price for our room with nothing more than a oh - sorry about that. It is a shamed that the week end crew with obviously NO management at all - could ruin the reputation of the regular staff who seemed to take some pride in the property."
717,Our stay was wonderful! Hotel itself was good once the construction is finished it will be much better
718,We had a great time. First time traveling with our dog. They made all of us feel welcone. Great breakfast buffet and lots of little touch that just added to the experience. The staff were very friendly and accmodating. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. We will be back :)
719,My wife and I came in for a wedding and the hotel staff made sure everything went great. Very nice people who were more than willing to help out.
720,"Did I stay at the same hotel as other reviewers This is not NOT an above average accommodation. I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround. Closer to town, it has a few stores within walking distance."
721,I told the lady at the desk that I don't have any complaints with the hotel. We will stay there again.
722,"This was an overnight trip to the beach. The location was ok, the road construction mentioned before is still ongoing but a quick u-ie didn't make getting in too terrible. All the members of staff were very friendly. I floated around the pool in the evening, maybe past closing time... perhaps we were quiet enough they didn't kick us out. In the morning I had my heart set on a muffin for breakfast, other than the banana nut and bran that were out, and they searched to no avail. The coffee shop down the road was great (snicker doodle muffin and iced chai, mmmmm)! Location made it easy to get around between Oak Island and Wilmington. Only negative was that the bed was hard. I couldn't seem to get comfortable at all."
723,"The hotel staff was friendly and the check-in / check-out process was simple. The room stayed clean and the bed was comfortable. The TV seemed to have the wrong picture format set on the hotel side of the broadcast to the room. When attempting to watch the Olympics, the left and right edges of the broadcast were cut-off and not visible. The parking lot is a touch too small for the amount of rooms available, at times it may be difficult to find a parking spot if returning to the hotel late at night. The location of the hotel being on the corner of NC-211 and NC-133 creates some difficulty getting in and out of the parking lot. My wife and I were able to drive into Southport for shopping and restaurants also visit Oak Island a little further south for the beaches."
724,"Having never been to Livermore, imagine my shock when the 2nd floor balcony room overlooked a parking lot and a gas station with a Jack in the Box thrown in for good measure. I thought I was staying in wine country. It would also have been nice to know that it is under construction. Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go. The only good thing I could say is the bed was comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel right off of a freeway this one fits the bill, although way overpriced."
725,"Our stay was a pleasant, overnight stay. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was tasty. Aside from the hotel having a tiny, swimming pool, I have nothing but praise. I am a picky person especially when it comes to cleanliness. I would not hesitate to return and plan to do so in the future. Go. Stay. Enjoy. It's a great value for the price."
726,Only complaint is the view. We stayed in room 329 and the view was depressing!
727,"Very good. The only problem was their room keys were not working. So every time you returned to your room. Someone had to escort you, and let you in. I was told that I would get a 20.00 credit for the problem. We would stay there again for sure."
728,Gave me a room that wasn't ready. I was exhausted from driving. Front desk was very apologetic and fixed the situation immediately. Staff quite nice. Room clean and comfortable.
729,"The staff at this hotel, all of them were wonderful, kind,friendly and courteous."
730,My daughter was in the Oak Island Triathalon. I choose to stay at Comfort Suites because of its reputation and closeness to Oak Island. I was very pleased with the hotel. Very clean and great staff.
731,We stayed after the very busy Memorial Day Week end. The key card machine had broke due to the large number of patrons over the week end. The staff were very friendly and walked us to our rooms to open the door and were staffed for coming and going due to this unusual situation.
732,"I stayed 3 nights at Comfort Suites. The staff is very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. The room was large and very comfortable. There is a lovely swimming pool outside. The location, half way between Southport and Oak Island, is very convenient and there are plenty of sights, beaches, and things to do in the close surroundings. The neighborhood is safe and there is plenty of parking space. I enjoyed the nice breakfast. If you stay on a busy week-end, the breakfast room gets packed and there is unfortunately not enough space for everyone to be sitting. This is the only downside to this wonderful and very affordable hotel in a great location"
733,"We were attending a wedding at Bald Head Island, and being from out of town, we needed to get a hotel. It was only for one night, and we didn't want to spend a lot of money, as we were only going to be in the room to sleep. We were very impressed with this hotel. It wasn't expensive, but it was very , very nice. Spotlessly clean... staff very helpful and friendly."
734,A place near southport. Clean and friendly. King suite Room was spacious and clean. Hotel is a little dated though.
735,"The bathroom sink splashes water, need to be fixed. The bathtub/shower make loud noises. Other than that, it was a good stay."
736,Difficult to get in or out due to construction. Not enough tables for breakfast otherwise nice comfortable hotel good service
737,"Our room was clean and comfortable except the throw size pillows on the bed. We did have an issue with the toilet overflowing the first day we arrived. The cleaning lady came by and cleaned it up and gave us a plunger. It continued to stop up/drain slow for the remainder of our two day stay. We did report it to the front desk, but whether anyone actually checked it out, I can't say. Other than being a nuisance, it wasn't a big issue. As for the location, we expected there to be more in South Port and were disappointed with the town overall. Next time we will stay at Carolina Beach or in Wilmington, which both have more things to do."
738,Expedia really screwed up our reservations and the staff went way out of their way to fix things. If it were not for the staff we would have been sleeping on the street and paying to do so. I will be very reluctant to ever book through Expedia again.
739,This trip was for a pleasant day at Oak Island It turn into a complete waste of time due to extreme traffic and construction in the area. The line was literally 10 mile back ups. Local traffic a mess Waiting in traffic to go to dinner for nearly 1-2 hrs. Hotel was a complete mess They had no key reader for your hotel room so every time you wanted to get back in you would have to get someone at front desk to let you in. What awful stay and a waste of my money!!! Would not recommend ! By the way they hide dirt well. Nasty
740,Didn't like the bathroom overhead light and fan being controlled by same switch. It disturbs the sleeping person when one goes to the bathroom.
741,We love it.. it's our go-to Island hotel. Great folks and great location and the breakfast is always good too!
742,"This was a great place to stay, only thing is that they do not serve breakfast till 6:30 am which i thought was strange beacause like me i like to get back on the road early so i missed it."
743,The staff were the nicest that I've ever had at a hotel.
744,"Hotel was very accommodating, staff very cordial and understanding as I had to change plans mid stream Convenient to all attractions and beach"
745,"Spent 2 nights in Southport. Furniture in room appeared older and worn in appearance.however they seem to be renovating. Very nice breakfast. TV service was poor. Most channels not working,luckily we were not in the room except at night the one negative about this stay was the traffic construction in front of the hotel which was a extreme hardship to entering and exiting"
746,Great
747,Could use an update on a few things... Noticed mold in shower and such but overall good experience!
748,This is a good hotel with quick access to oak island or down town Southport. The room was bigger than we anticipated. Which was nice. Front desk staff was friendly. Only negative was the road construction going on overnight. It was loud at times. Wish we slept on the other side of the hotel. But that's temporary. When finished we will stay there again.
749,The staff was very friendly and efficient. An added touch was the fresh popcorn made each afternoon. It was a welcome surprise. Another feature that adds to my stay is the inclusion of breakfast and a fresh cup of coffee. My only complaint is that sound was easily heard between rooms. It seems many hotels have this problem. Other than that I have a very pleasant stay.
750,It was in the middle of all the town we were able to drive to.
751,On the way into Southport and convenient to going into town and the restaurants.
752,Really enjoyed our stay. The beds are very comfy and the staff very friendly. The lady that cooked breakfast named Vicki did an awesome job on breakfast and was helpful to us with questions we had about the island.
753,"A web sight highly rated this hotel. For this reason and with a good rate, I booked the hotel. As is our practice, we bring wipes to clean the phone, door knobs, TV remote and bathroom etc. We found all of the above dirty. The bath grab handle was all mold. We covered the handle when the tub was used. I did not complain to the hotel because the were begining a remodel of the public bath which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling."
754,I will definitely be staying here again. The middle aged woman at the front desk (I can't remember her name) was very polite and very helpful. She gave me a neat little map of the whole area and told me and my wife where good places to eat and visit. Our room was clean and setup really nice. The breakfast was good. I will be coming back here next time I visit this side of the beach.
755,"Room was clean, attractive and well priced. Staff was friendly. My only critique is that the dining room is a little small for the size of the hotel and there is some road work that made entering the parking lot a little confusing (obviously the latter is not the hotels fault.)"
756,Nice room with ample space and a comfortable bed. Breakfast was scrambled eggs and bicuits and gravy. waffles and assorted juces and fruits.
757,Nice in/out along the freeway. I thought it was a little high for what it was.
758,The bed on the floor above us was super noisy. I asked the Front Desk to change our room and they were able to do so. Breakfast wasn't very tasty.
759,"We weren't in the room much but the bed was comfortable, had all the basic amenities besides hot breakfast, pool (we didn't get to use), etc. it was clean. We weren't really near much but beaches, other cities weren't too far away. Enjoyed our stay there."
760,great place to stay breakfast was awsome
761,Worst hotel experience ever. The hotel's card reader was broken so no key was given out. They simply wrote down your room number and you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time. So anyone could have gotten in my room at any time. Plus the staff expressed how annoyed they were by having to do this. I felt as if I could never leave my room. Was not offered a discount or an apology. Will never go back.
762,"Large room, very nice overall."
763,"I enjoyed the hotel accommodations. The staff was polite but not very helpful. I discovered stuff on my own. The room was clean,comfortable quiet."
764,Everything was great from check-in to checkout except that we had to go to another floor for ice and I had to track down housekeeping staff to change sheets and bring more clean towels. We were out for several hours and expected this done when we got back to our room.
765,Beds and pillows were nice. And the television was good as well. The pool was closed.
766,"Warm welcome, in French Change of bed linen every day, comfortable bed, good size bathroom and well team. Hearty breakfast and variety."
767,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The breakfast in the morning was delicious with a good selection of food and beverages. We will definitely stay here again and refer friends and family too."
768,Close to freeway on/off ramp. enjoyed the stay
769,"This hotel was promoted as being in the wine country. However, it was a block from the freeway. When we asked the desk clerk about this, she pointed her finger toward the door and said, It's about 4 miles that way. We had a great view of Jack in the Box parking lot. When we first entered our room and kicked off our shoes, we found ourselves stepping on numerous sand burrs left on the carpet. After working out and returning to our room at 9am, there was no hot water for the shower. The breakfast was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly."
770,Came for concert at Wente. Last time I traveled to area the accomodations had a shuttle service. That would be a nice amenity if you could add it. Great clean place to stay.
771,"Only problem we had was that we were not informed of the teen basketball tournament going on in the city. As a result, lots of kids, the room next to ours had the TV blaring until midnight and then on again a 5 am. We went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing left. We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat. Outside of that, our stay was very nice. The gentleman at the front desk was especially cordial and accommodating."
772,It was cold in the room. We couldn't get the heater on easily for some reason but then when the heat temperature finally came on we were sweating in the middle of the night. I would like a better thermostat or better direction. The hot breakfast was great!!!
773,"All the rooms have been recently renovated. They are in the process of renovating the lobby area. The room was new and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bed linen looks new too. Its also nice to have electrical sockets at desk level and plenty of them. The breakfast was so so... eggs, sausages and hashbrown (no fruits) but barely edible."
774,"Let's face it, this is NOT in the Livermore 'wine country'.... you can throw a rock from your room to busy InterState 580 and never come close to a vine or vineyard!"
775,It was OK . they paid for the ice I purached.
776,I must say the GM at this hotel Catherine is the bomb! She was very attentive and helpful. The hotel was very clean and the staff were all very nice to us from the moment we walked in the door. I would stay here every time I'm in California. Thanks again Cat!
777,It was ok hotel is nice from in and out but room was small we paid for double bed bat they atteched 2 single bed
778,"The hotel was great, but the Buffet Breakfast was the worst I have ever had! The bacon taste like cardboard, eggs and sausage were cold, Pastries were hard and very little fruit. The only thing hot and worth eating was fixing yourself a waffle at the waffle machine if you didn't mind waiting in line for it."
779,"The Hawthorne Suites offers an affordable, comfortable environment that is convenient to the 580 freeway (just south of it) and within a mile and a half of downtown Livermore. Room was incredibly clean and comfortable. While they are currently going through a renovation, which I think will be really nice once it is completed, we rarely had any indication of the ongoing construction activities. Staff was very friendly and accommodating."
780,My family stated the place was nice as they were here for my wedding. Location was great and only 10 minutes away from destinations.
781,"Very comfortable rooms, will stay again when in the area."
782,Staff was great and rooms were clean and very comfortable.
783,"Stayed at this hotel as part of a nearby wedding. I have to say I was impressed. Was greeted by Catherine at the front desk. I had spoke with her earlier before arriving and she was great on the phone and she was so sweet at check in. Very friendly, accommodating, and engaging. Really started the stay off right. The... More"
784,"What a pleasant surprise! We are use to staying at expensive four star hotels but needed to complete a quick business trip and we were so delighted with this hotel. All newly remodeled, pleasant professional staff, and the hot breakfast was a perfect addition. Highly recommend and you will not be disappointed!"
785,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We were very impressed by the dcor everything was clean and felt very upscale. The hotel is located near the freeway. There is a gas station, fast food, and shopping nearby. We were in town for a family event so we didn't do much exploring, but there seemed to be many amenities right in the area. The best part was the proximity to downtown Livermore. Wonderful shopping and dining opportunities, and only 5 minutes away. Also, the wineries are within a 10 minute drive. All in all, a wonderful place to stay and lots to do in the area."
786,The most convenient place to stay in Livermor and where we will stay in the future.
787,Very nice for the price.
788,"Class Frhstck, friendly and attentive staff, good connections to Venice, room vllig ok and clean, parking in the nhe well accessible. Wrden we choose again!"
789,"The room was clean, spacious, and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were in Livermore for a two-day stay, and it was a nice quiet retreat in the midst of family chaos."
790,"All was great, until the heater/AC came on. It sounded like a vacuum cleaner every time it turned on. Waking me up over and over. The room would get to hot then to cold. Had a horrible night sleep. Vroom -- Vroom. Clean, friendly, comfy bed, all ruined by a Motel-6 quality wall unit."
791,There's nothing wrong with the hotel except that there are flood lights shining in your window while you sleep and the curtains don't close. I really like the furniture The bedding was clean the pillows are great. Next time I will ask for a room with windows on the other side.
792,"The hotel itself was very nice. Staff was very helpful, especially with accommodating us when we asked to check in early. The problem was with cleanliness. Our room was not clean enough - I found a floss stick on the table in our room. What looked like a condom was found when we went to use the spa. And the pool was full of leaves and dirt on the bottom. Otherwise, our room would have been great. Very large with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Nice large screen tv as well - made my husband happy."
793,"Mediocre. The carpets and elevator reek of sour wine. Evidently they have regular wine Thursdays here. Service was somewhat lacking. I requested a wakeup call, they didn't do it. Finally, the free breakfast was on the poor side. Daddy, this bacon tastes like tuna."
794,"Nice experience, despite the re-modeling construction. Friendly and courteous hotel staff. Beautiful new room decor and ambience."
795,"One night only, but a nice one. New renno's high quality throughout. Comfy, modern accomodation. Our room overlooked grazing cattle and the relentless I-580, so it was busy, but totally silent. We'll be back."
796,"Guy at front desk was a jerk, smart Alec"
797,"When I made reservations at this hotel, I had average expectations at that that price rate for that area. However the newly renovated room, the professional staff and the cleanliness and the comfort of really surprised me and I will definitely go back."
798,"We stayed for two nights. The lobby was nice and the breakfast was good. However, the room was not properly cleaned upon arrival and the same issues remained on the second day. Would have expected much better at this price."
799,"Very nice obsuga, the atmosphere of the hotel. a zonau, view of the bays. Very good price/quality ratio. Recommend!"
800,I have stayed here twice now and loved it both times. Staff are very courteous and welcoming. The pool can use an upgrade but we still had a great time lounging next to the pool.
801,"Clean, safe, friendly, brand new, hotel- :)"
802,"The last time I stayed at this hotel, it was under remodeling and one of the rooms I was placed in had a heating unit that did not work. I moved to another room, which was okay, but not as nice a room. This time, my granddaughter and I checked in at about 4:30 p.m. and the room was extremely... More"
803,Visiting family
804,"Perfect, best hotel over others in the area"
805,The hotel is under renovation so lobby and other areas were blocked off. Room was very nice but breakfast were less than tasty.
806,"Staff was very nice. Hotel is updating it's lobby and reception area so there was a bit of construction. Did not hamper anything. Breakfast was fine, room was nice and quite spacious and again hotel employees were very nice."
807,Great hotel in a great neighborhood. Will definitely be staying here again. Room was very spacious. Free breakfast was great! It was raining so we didn't get to use the pool but it seemed very nice. A little pricey but its a very nice hotel! Free wi-fi and free parking - additional pluses!
808,"Very comfortable and accommodating. From making our reservation to our time spent, the Hawthorn in Livermore was really nice. I did have to find the direct phone number to get assurance our needs would be met as the central hotel reservation system is simply not equipped to handle any details. Once accessed the staff was most gracious and reassuring and... More"
809,"I work in Livermore and stayed the night to celebrate with friends. The location is close to downtown and the local wineries. My boyfriend and I were very pleased with the accommodations, the room was clean and large. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. I will stay here again."
810,Large terrace. Nra to the human lido beach.Just a TV channel. Good breakfast. Small impractical bathroom. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
811,"A nice hotel, it was undergoing renovation when I stayed so shou be finished soon. Staff was helpful and friendly. Only complaint is the breakfast."
812,"I live somewhat local in Redwood City, but it's far enough away that after spending the evening with High School Friends, having a 30th gathering wasn't an official reunion, at a local beer pub, we didn't want to chance driving home after having a few beers. We made the reservation Friday night, and honestly, was apprehensive because of some of the reviews. Pleasantly surprised! The place was clean, it's had a facelift and looks good. The bathroom tub could use an update... but I have stayed in the W in downtown Chicago and the tub was worse and room was horrible. I'd take this room over that one any day! The breakfast the next morning was good. Nothing to write home about, but it offers a great selection and the eggs weren't watered down. Sausage was good... bacon... well, that looked and smelled like a dog treat. Passed on that one. But the coffee was decent and overall, was very pleased with our last minute choice to stay there... would do it again and would recommend others! It was 1/2 mile from the pub and right at the freeway, so leaving was easy, too."
813,Excellent Staff
814,"We booked this hotel because we had a wedding. It was impeccable, comfortable, and they had an excellent breakfast."
815,"I was at the hotel for a wedding and all of the staff, Catherine in particular, were incredibly helpful and accommodating. I also loved that there were different types of pillows on the beds!"
816,"Stayed here for a wedding weekend. Easily accessible from the freeway, 5min drive to downtown Livermore, good weekend stay for wine tasting or weddings, not much of a view in any direction. Rooms were clean with modern decor. Parking was free. Free continental breakfast. They were remodeling the dining area during our stay but it didn't bother us too much.... More"
817,"Very nice hotel and staff, the location was also perfect because it was easy to get to due being close freeway exit."
818,"Our family reserved 6 rooms for 2-4 days for a family event. 3 of the 6 rooms had some significant disappointments, including blood and feces on the sheets, and roaches in the room. Our daughter turned her refrigerator on upon check in and then stocked it with food. Housekeeping turned it off and the food spoiled. Gentleman at the front... More"
819,"Everything was good. The front desk staff was fine, but I thought they could've been a more friendly and welcoming."
820,"Sheets were filthy, jacuzzi was freezing with bugs in it, the breakfast had options but the eggs and bacon tasted terrible!"
821,The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. My wife and I had a room with a terrace over looking the water... it was a great view! I will look to stay at this hotel my next time in Venice... very pleased.
822,"Wanted to check out their wine tasting, the wine trolly was fun and affordable, the wine was great, the food downtown was good, nice atmosphere. Our Hotel was conveniently located very close to everything we wanted to do. Got some great deals at the outlets, which were close by, as well. Great weekend stay."
823,The pillows were way too soft without pillowcases. The mattress was so soft my back was aching. When i awoke in the am since I arrived so late and did not notice I flipped the covers off and there was dried blood on the sheets. I could not leave fast enough. Sorry but never again. The next night I stayed... More
824,"Clean, comfortable room. Breakfast was good. Coffee not bad. The bacon was weird. Soy maybe Kinda gross. Many people threw it away. Everything else was fine. Not over the top amazing, but I think I got my money's worth."
825,"Super solid, well-maintained but nothing to write home about. Breakfast buffet, while complimentary was pretty lackluster, but a nice feature nonetheless."
826,"I frequently go to Livermore for business travel and always stay at this hotel. The hotel is always clean, beds are super comfy, staff is friendly, free breakfast in the morning and wine in the evening. What else could you ask for when you are traveling"
827,"Stayed for a week - from early check-in assistance to excellent accommodations, it was all I could hope for in a multi-day business stay."
828,one night stay to attend concert/dinner at winery
829,"This hotel has a great, friendly staff, clean rooms, comfy beds and pillows and the price is right. Would stay there again when I am in town."
830,"I expected more from a Wyndham hotel...... bathroom was very small, not enough counter space for makeup bag and shaving kit. Amenities were not replenished. Had to ask for coffee replacements, then were given single serve bags for a 4 cup coffee maker! Coffee maker eventually replaced, but I had to ask... twice! And the word suite. Is not too accurate.... More"
831,My husband and I came out here from Tennessee for a business conference / couples getaway. It's our first full day here and I'm already so impressed with this hotel! The hotel and the room are both clean and pretty . The staff is super friendly and the front desk girl even printed out a map of things I might... More
832,"Nice hotel , with very friendly staff and helpful - great choice for breakfast , something for everyone."
833,"We have always chosen this hotel for location and comfort, as well as value. Now with updated decor we love it even more. There was even a chaise lounge with a computer table, as well as lots of outlets for our electronics. Front staff is always helpful and polite."
834,excellent service and location for wedding party. staff worked hard at accommodating numerous guests.
835,"The hotel was fine, I with the shower (specifically the shower head) was cleaner, it could you a thorough scrubbing and white vinegar cleaning."
836,We found this hotel because of its connection to the Livermore Shakespeare Festival. They offered a dinner-theater-hotel package that was perfect for our first time at this venue. The hotel is conveniently located close enough to the freeway to be easily accessible but far enough away to be out of the traffic noise. The Hawthorn staff were very pleasant and... More
837,Fun overnight stay
838,My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights for a wedding in Livermore in July. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. There is absolutely no excuse for stealing my friend's personal belongings whom were also staying at this hotel the same nights. I left my cell phone charger in room 305 and came back a few... More
839,"My husband and I stayed at the Hawthorne Suites by Wyndham Livermore,CA. for my daughter's wedding, as did many of their guests. It was wonderful!

I was even escorted by the police out of the hotel. This was about money. I was charged for something I didn't receive.... More"
841,"Our room was on the ground floor, facing the parking lot. This meant that any time our curtains were open, we were on display for whoever was walking/driving by. It also meant we couldn't safely leave our window(s) open at night and had to rely on the very, very loud air conditioner. Although outdated, our room was very reasonable. There... More"
842,Came to Binghamton to visit with a relative. Fairfield Inn is a convenient location. Nearby is Ostinango Park which is great for walking or running.
843,"The room was clean and comfortable. The room height was about 1.5m in most parts. A bracelet and a cardigan were stolen from our room. The spa was not in the hotel but about a kilometer pss in another hotel. It was a mile from the pier to the hotel. Lido Island is a good place to stay when visiting Venice, but I do not recommend tt hotel."
844,Great Experience. Nice Staff clean rooms good free breakfast
845,"Not a lot of options where I needed to stay for work, but this hotel was nice. Fairly updated and the staff was friendly. Walking distance to Cracker Barrel and Applebee's, which was nice. Other restaurants within driving distance. Easy to get to, right off interstate. If I was back in town for work, I'd stay here again for sure."
846,This hotel is undergoing construction. Banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning. Forget about enjoying a peaceful morning. Was very disappointed by the reaction of the hotel staff when I brought it to their attention. A free night's stay or at least a discount on my next stay may have helped the situation. Dont book this hotel until the construction is complete
847,"Good Location, right off highway. Applebees next door... you can walk there! Hallway was dirty but the roomwas very clean and comfortable."
848,"The hotel was fairly new and slightly out of town. The pool was refreshing. Breakfast was adequate but as usual in hotels like this, when crowded jockeying for a spot to sit can be a challenge."
849,"Rooms are very small, especially for a family of 4. Beds were not very comfortable and the bathroom was also small (straddle the toilet to close the door small). The pool area was not so great. Hot tub was cloudy and the whole area had a septic smell."
850,Needs more ice machines.
851,"The staff at the Fairfield Inn were amazing. They arranged a cab for us, offered us hot tea after a late night arrival on a very cold evening, they check in on us the next day to make sure we were settled and had everything we needed. They made sure our stay at their hotel was comfortable. An extra thank you to Candice, Bea, and Donna. Thank you ladies for going above and beyond. Great breakfast in the morning too!!"
852,"Easily accessible in spite of traffic on 17. Clean. Bath a teensy bit small but still acceptable. We had a king bed - that's all they had available, but the two doubles may have been a little tight. We did use a rollaway cot for our son (5'10, 150lbs) and wound up putting the mattress on the floor the second night as the frame was simply too small for a teenage boy!"
853,"I often stay at Hampton Inns but one was not conveniently located so I opted for this Fairfield Inn near Bingham ton because it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier. What a mistake ! The motel, although the room was clean and comfortable, was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities. I would have walked out but I had a no cancellation reservation. When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul. So. if the management knew it was not up to snuff why the high rate. This experience guarantees that I will avoid Fairfield in the future and recommend that other travelers stay away also"
854,"DON'T stay here unless you're less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes. Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have."
855,"visiting family... convienient to get to... room was clean... pool water could have been warmer... overall, we were satisfied."
856,It was convenient a little noisy in the room with the traffic on the road (room facing the front of the building).
857,"Overpriced, small room with absolutely no view, furnishings showed years of wear and tear, small bath with thin towels, very mediocre breakfast. Worst and most expensive hotel we stayed in on a 11 night vacation sleeping in 9 different cities in 6 states"
858,"since most important thing for me is bed comfort, I'd say this is a winner. Nice staff, clean room. Breakfast was standard low quality mass free food, but that is to be expected."
859,Pool was good temp.. hot tub very enjoyable. Breakfast was good with lots of choices
860,"Clean, spacious room. Pool and hot tub were clean."
861,"This was a very nice hotel. The staff was particularly friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast was great, and they had the most comfortable beds I have slept in at a hotel! Would highly recommend."
862,"Everything was great - very clean hotel, very clean room, excellent service at the front desk, great variety of food at breakfast. Only downside was the cost."
863,"This was a fine, clean hotel. Good-sized pool and exercise room. Rooms were clean, check-in was easy. Good breakfast with waffles, eggs, bacon, yogurt, muffins, etc., etc."
864,"This was a fine, clean hotel. Good-sized pool and exercise room. Rooms were clean, check-in was easy. Good breakfast with waffles, eggs, bacon, yogurt, muffins, etc., etc."
865,Really lovely hotel. Stayed on the very top floor and were surprised by a Jacuzzi bath we didn't know we were getting! Staff were friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was great! Great location and great value for money. Didn't want to leave!
866,"We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself."
867,"This is the only place I will stay in Binghamton when I am there. It is the cleanest, friendliest, and has the best breakfast around for the price. I choose Fairfield Inn's because I consistantly have a pleasurable experience there."
868,Was hoping for a nicer room based on higher room rates than other offerings. What we found was just a plain room. Wished we had stayed somewhere else for our money. Breakfast was good value and well served.
869,"We were very happy with our stay. Very nice hotel with super friendly staff. Room was clean and spacious. Had microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker. Pool area and exercise room were nice clean. Continental breakfast had lots of choices and tasted great! Loved that it was just a quick walk next door to dinner. Definitely would recommend to family friends and will absolutely stay again!"

872,Adequate is the word I'd use.
873,all good.
874,very nice.
875,"We stayed here the night before a 5k Color Run. The room was very clean - but my son did find a skittle under the bed, wedged into the corner. I think it's his goal to find 'anything' when he enters a hotel room. The beds were very comfy as were the pillows, and we were even able to enjoy the pool for a while. All in all this was a very nice hotel and the staff was great. They didn't even cringe when we walked back in after the run covered in wild colors :-)"
876,Clean comfortable room with pleasant staff. No problems.
877,"We booked the hotel for 4 nchte in the week before Easter. The stay was pleasant throughout. The Frhstcksbuffet was rich and fresh (although I advise against the Rhrei). If something was used up, it was immediately flare-up. From the Frhstcksraum you could enjoy the view over the lagoon. Although our room was located on the ground floor to the side street, it was very quiet there. The décor is tasteful and functional. There was no lack of cleanliness. Although we did not make the claim, the hand-held ones were changed. The only shortcoming was the temperature of the shower water. It changed from pretty cold to very hot. The washbasin is also worth a simline. The faucet is quite small and so mounted over the protruding up that it is already difficult to wash the hnde underneath. The reception at the reception was very friendly. Unfortunately, our suitcase had not arrived with us. The nice receptionist was looking around and kept in touch with the airport. On the next day we were notified from the hotel that our suitcase was now there. Right near the hotel is a bus stop. However, we never took the bus, as the way to the jetty was not far for the water buses. Waiting for the closest bus was sometimes more lng than going to Fu to the jetty."
878,"We stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. It's close to the highway, which was convenient for us. Room was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings. However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldn't have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotel's fault but still... Would return but probably only if there is no other option."
879,"We stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. It's close to the highway, which was convenient for us. Room was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings. However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldn't have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotel's fault but still... Would return but probably only if there is no other option."

883,"The room we had was roomy and comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was a basic offering but much appreciated. The toilet tank had a small leak, but was only evident the morning of checkout."
884,The only complaint was trying to regulate the heat/cooling system.
885,"Nice, clean and new motel. Wish the bathroom was a bit bigger. Wife did a quick turn and bruised her hip o the metal door latch."
886,"Nice Hotel, close to Applebees, which delivered right to your room. The continental breakfast was also very good."
887,"Good experience and very convenient to where I needed to be. Hotel was quiet and staff polite and helpful. Conveniently located between two restaurants that serve decent food at reasonable prices. Only downside was that hotel room was a bit dusty... not unclean but bedside lamp had dust on base. Very well out-fitted with outlets, however, which is needed these days. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay."
888,"Lovely hotel, 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido. Away from the madness of Venice, but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes."
889,From the moment of check in we were pleased. Greeted cordially (not fake) we were asked if we would need anything additional (we were 6 adults and 5 children under the age of 6 renting 3 rooms). They had already put our rooms nearby (even when requested at other hotels in advance this seems to be a HUGE request and usually not done) We have stayed at other hotels in the area but your rooms are spacious and beds are wonderful. We will continue to return here anytime we are in the area.
890,"We were thrilled with everything from the cleanliness to the top notch breakfast to the kindness of everyone but, the very first person we met. She was the first person we approached behind the counter when we arrived. Later we learned that she was handling both the desk and the Housekeeping roles that night. If I were to judge the facility by this one person, I would have been disappointed in her lack of hospitality in answering our questions: no smile, no patience... cranky. However the rest of our stay, and we did add an extra night, more than made up for it. This was my first getaway in 4 years on ANY kind of vacation/family celebration, so I was really hoping for a good time. I really enjoyed the cleanliness, as I own a cleaning service here in MD. Thank you so much for an overall excellent stay!!!"
891,"The staff was indifferent to my stay. For example, almost had to convince the front desk to go through the effort to sell me another night stay. I almost went to another hotel because it seemed too much trouble to check me out and then check me back in. Not likely to return."
892,Travel mid point stop over
893,"I had never stayed at a Fairfield Inn. I was very impressed with the staff., they were excellent. The rooms were great and the service was even better. Would definitely recommend anyone looking for a hotel to stay at a Fairfield Inn."
894,"Very friendly staff and excellent breakfast choices. I question that the comforter was not double sheeted but had a light weight searsucker spread on it. Also, we received half used bottle of shampoo."

896,"Easy on/off 81. Good service. I had requested a rollaway bed with my reservation, but they said the request wasn't there. No matter - they had one in my room within 20 mins of check-in. Overall, we were pleased."
897,The room was very clean. Staff very friendly. I was not impressed with the breakfast.
898,"nice hotel, in a convenient location to IS 81. I appreciated the great breakfast, then quick access to the highway."
899,"Located on the island of Lido next to Venice, right on the seafront overlooking Venice. Lido can be reached very easily by boat. From the boat mooring it is about 400 m to the hotel along the Kste. We had to make our way to Fu, as no buses go there because of a construction site. We were very friendly, the staff at the hotel was very nice and helpful. The room was furnished, the bathroom relatively large and everything very clean and tidy. We were also very satisfied with the Frhstcksbffet - good quality and relatively large selection. We were completely satisfied and would book the hotel again immediately."
900,Free wifi throughout hotel
901,Would have loved to know they were under going major renovations before I booked the room. But considering they were it was still a nice place to stay. Staff was extremely friendly and the rooms were very nice and clean. Pool and hot tub very nice an clean as well.
902,Everything has higher our expectations I highly recommend it
903,"The room was fine... the bathroom was VERY small, but otherwise an OK stay."
904,Hotel seemed clean. Staff was pleasant. Room seemed clean but it smelled very musty. I'm not sure why it smelled that way. It would be much better if they offered rooms with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds.

906,"We had a great stay. Have been to this hotel before. I would suggest the pool area floor be replaced though . It is very slippery!!! And I had to call the front desk for towels. Rooms are very nice ,beds very comfortable. Love that we can walk to Applebee's or Cracker Barrel."
907,"Very comfortable. Great spread for a free breakfast buffet. The indoor pool was big enough (not huge), though the room was steamy. Friendly staff."
908,Our late evening arrival was no problem for the staff person who registered us. The parking access was perfect for my wife's limited mobility and for carting our luggage to the room and back. The breakfast buffet was well provisioned and the server friendly and accommodating.
909,The staff was great. We decided to stay another day and they were very helpful. The room was extremely comfortable
910,"Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!"
911,The staff was great. We decided to stay another day and they were very helpful. The room was extremely comfortable
912,"This hotel is a dump! Upon checking in was told that the place was booked with folks who are running from Isaac -- the folks are depressed, sad and crying -- we got a room with no problem as a matter of fact the parking lot and inside hotel were rather empty despite the fact that the place was booked -- the room reaked -- air conditioning unit blew out luke warm air despite having control turned to high cool -- linens and bath towels were rough and ... view morewell worn. The corridors reaked of curry/incense and it was obvious other air freshners were used to mask the obvious odors. Not opposed to other cultures but if you are going to have that sort of thing waifing through the hotel you should advertise such. My expectations are a clean room with no visible signs of anything else... would NOT recommend this place... BTW the free breakfast was nothing more than day old bakery goods with what was suppose to be biscuits and gravy... the folks running from Isaac would have been better off to weather the storm! Use this place only as a very last resort!view less"
913,"Room looked to be in disrepair, bathroom door didn't shut without force. The hostess was very unprofessional with her stars and bar finger nails."
914,The room smelled bad. Not very clean to say the least. I would sleep in my car before stay here again.

921,The room was very clean and the breakfast was very good.
922,charged online and prepaid room but reception did not have this and had to pay for room again. The online price was aprox. 40.00 more than check in price. Management would only refund cheaper price.
923,"The rooms were OK, but there was no insulation or soundproofing. You could hear every noise both upstairs and next door, not only that but every time a car started outside, it sounded like it was in your room!"

925,"The hotel was easy off and on the highway, and reasonably priced, which were our main points for selection. The night clerk was very helpful for our issue. But that doesn't outweigh the huge negative of finding a condom wrapper between the sheets with suspicious spots on the blanket, which led us to believe they had not been changed from a prior guest. Upon my request, both were replaced and we were offered a different room, but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket. Disgusting. If I hadn't booked on line I would have insisted on my money back. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone!"

940,Nice night of leisure on a long trip. The service staff were friendly courteous and very helpful. The beds were comfortable and the location was quiet and afforded a good night sleep. I have stayed several times in the past and never dissatisfied with my stay or any of the staff.

942,"We stayed here on our way to visit family. We got to the motel, Melissa the front desk clerk, was very friendly and got us checked in quickly. The rooms were big and seemed clean enough at first but as we settled in for the night we could tell the housekeepers defiantly needed to be retrained on how to clean... More"
943,We had a room with balcony overlooking the lagoon - wonderful!!!
944,Terrible stay. Everything in the room felt damp as it was terribly humid. The place was dated and breakfast omelets were made in a different ZIP code or worse. The orange juice burned our throats fro the acidity. They had a cardboard like of the man in the advertisents. Now everytime I see his likeness I will run away.
945,"Easy and quick check-in. Room was a positive surprise, clean and spacious Pet friendly . Breakfast was basic but good good half way point from Phoenix to Milwaukee. Next trip we will stay here again."
946,Overall stay was ok. The towels could have used a little more in the wash. They were dingy and you could see past stains on them. Walls had hand stains on them. Will most likely not stay here again.

956,"This is a GREAT place to use as a home base for exploring Mobile. Steve and Enoch know Mobile very well and can refer to all sorts of attractions, restaurants, etc. Mobile itself is just exquisite and is a fascinating place (at 300+ yearsw, it's one of the oldest cities in the US) and the downtown restaurants are TERRIFIC. Of the bed and breakfasts I've visited, Berney Fly is the closest to perfection. Steve and Enoch are wonderful and attentive hosts, the rooms are immaculate, the service is first-rate (and be sure to check out their pool in the back!). A definite must stay."

The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff, particularly Ms. Annalucia Ms. Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles. The breakfasts were very good, with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure (more important when you are with toddlers!) Would surely go back to Venice would happily stay again at Russo Palace."

Great, place, to stay, if you don't mind having big hotel luxury, but your in Hawaii, so you'll be out everyday, enjoying, so save money and stay here, Aloha! !!!!!!!!"
996,We stayed here for about a week in October 2015. We checked in with no problems and were given a key that would allow us to use the elevator and access the stairs. The elevator is a little bit sketchy but we never really used it (only for when we arrived with all the luggage and for when we left).... More
997,We stayed here for over a month as we have just moved to Honolulu and had to sort a permanent place to stay. The Manager and Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make sure they had a room for us and worked with us during our stay - as we didn't know when we would... More
998,"Hey, if you want a Hilton or even a Holiday Inn this may not be for you but if you want Waikiki on a hometown beach budget its a winner! Tucked in behind the big towers on the beach the reach the sky in altitude and price is Polynesian Plaza. An older place but comfy like your favorite couch is... More"
999,"It was a 10 min+ walk to water bus, would have liked it closer. Located on the water on Lido island, away from the rush of Venice"
1000,"I booked this hotel for mid October months ago. In early October, I called this hotel to find out more about the bathroom size and to my horror, the hotel just cancelled my reservations without informing me. Can you imagine if I had arrived on that day with 2 children to only find out I have no where to stay... More"
1001,"For the price that I paid for the room, it was horrific meaning that when me and my wife got into the room, IT WAS VERY HOT! The next thing was that the elevator wasn't working, it took us over 45 minutes to find out that the hotel didn't have a parking spot after making circles and finally, the shower... More"
1002,"Rooms were nice, basic but a good size, older style. No mod cons. The beds were very comfortable. Good size kitchenette. Great location. Nice pool. Wifi was only free down in common area which was pretty much completely outside so not fun when raining. And it wasn't the best wifi. Better to go to Starbucks. There was wifi available in... More"
1003,"This is an older property but it is super clean, never saw a bug anywhere! It is the best location-in my opinion-with everything from awesome dining to 3 blocks walk to public beach (with beachside drinks/snack shack). Love the 5-6 food truck court just one block away on Beachwalk Ave. Amazing shopping (Prada, Coach, Louis Vitton, etc.) just across the... More"
1004,"The entrance to the hotel is low key and between two retail stores on busy the Kalakaua Avenue. You could easily pass by its entrance on the street and miss it. Their Waikiki location is very good for shopping and access to TheBus. If you know what you want to visit on Oahu, I strongly recommend using the economical and... More"
1005,"The only reason for the 4th star is the location and staff. The hotel is located 10 minutes from the beach, opposite Tiffany's/Coach/Burberry and right downstairs is an amazing ramen restaurant. It is walking distance to all the necessary amenities. Its quite hidden, walked past several times and had to double back. Also safe at night as you need a... More"
1006,Great location but subpar accommodations.
1007,I knew this wasn't going to be amazing simply because of the price and previous reviews. It wasn't horrible but it doesn't look like the website at all..... Like at all. It's livable and the location is great. You can get parking really close for 24 a day. The wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction. They... More
1008,"Not exactly a five-star hotel but right in the heart of the Waikiki shopping precinct and a fairly short walk to the beach. Surrounded by high-end shops and restaurants, the accommodation is basic but you will money left over for shopping and sightseeing. An ABC convenience store across the road which sells food, clothing and booze. Get a unit fronting... More"
1009,"Unprepared for firstly the unwelcoming entrance to this establishment. Up a narrow walkway, past a lift that reminded me of the ancient ones in Paris To find the Office a room out by the pool area with 3/4 of the window area covered with glass like banks used to have'. We had to bend down to talk to the not... More"
1010,Room was tiny-bed saggy-bAthroom door didn't work. Good breakfast and convenient location. Wouldn't return or recommend.
1011,"Most may not like a tired appearance, but the place was clean, provided cooking facilities, WiFi, a very comfortable queen bed. Would be one of the cheapest hotels amongst a lot of 5 stars hotels at a fraction of cost"
1012,"We had a one night stay at your hotel, Sept. 19. 2015. It had to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Upon arrival we discovered that the elevator was broken. I was traveling with an elderly gentleman and the stairs were the only way to our room. Due to time constraints and our one night stay in... More"
1013,"Since there was no suitable room left in the main house, I booked an apartment in the separate app.-house. The ground-floor apartment was well furnished with a very snowy bathroom. Unfortunately, the access to the other apartments passed directly at the bedroom window, which was associated with very strending noise development."
1014,"We had a super fast-mouthed room with first-class service (unfortunately the beds with visitor's scribble, ... :-( ) Frhstck is also highly recommended, everything the heart desires, it is still added until the last minute. Fr Langschlfer, you will also be asked again before the abrumen of the Bfett (11:30 o'clock) if you still want something. The sauna closed at 21:00, which is a bit frh on holiday. But otherwise we were all around to peace. Khlungsborn we will definitely be back."
1015,"Very nice hotel with very nice atmosphere. Definitely something I'd recommend. The interior was renovated probably 10 years ago, so it's not brand new, but it's clean and comfortable. The Hotel CEO and the manager on duty took their time to talk to all guests one evening and ask about our stay etc. over a glass of champagne (free of charge). I've never seen such good service at a hotel. I should mention the spa and pool - very good bonus. If I had to say something negative - the internet connection. It's simply criminal to have such a slow and unstable internet connection in 2015. And may be, king size beds that are not to single beds with tendency to move apart."
1016,"The rooms ( app. ) were not located in the main house (no indication of it), during the period of our stay construction work in several rooms were carried out simultaneously (tiles removed, tubs, shower trgers, roof work, etc.) Fr Bademntel must be paid a loan fee, since apartment, normal rooms free of charge, cleaning (no broom or the same in the app. ) and towel change for a fee, since apartment, is only available on the homepage of the hotel, not at Expedia itself. For use of the SPA about 75 m along the road, since again in the main house. Frhstck sufficient, was with us incl., otherwise 18,- p. P. we find something overt. Staff super nice. A discount was granted to the Mngel."
1017,"Wunderschne room, bathrobe aisle optimal, Frhstck very tasty in cosy atmosphere. Parking 8 euros a day for the hotel frf f. unfortunately not to good service. otherwise all the best"
1018,"The room resembled a small apartment with seperatem bedrooms, living room with small box line and bathroom. Stay with dog was possible and was even swallowed with a small attention for the four-legged friend. The Frhstck was very tasty and had a rich selection. Everything was very clean and tidy. Only at the reception was a staff member very bloton and pathetic. First we were instructed and we were assigned a parking space. After we were already standing and wanted to go to the town centre, the employee stopped us and told us that we now pay 15 per night for the parking lot. When asked why we had not been informed beforehand, we received the patty answer that this is all over the place and can also be found on the website. My opinion Even if - a customer-friendly employee htte 1.) friendly response and 2.) from service considerations in any case, it should be pointed out again beforehand. Unfortunately, we didn't remember the employee's name. The others, however, were all very friendly and much more helpful than this one. All in all, you can highly recommend a stay here - if you ask for the information yourself and in advance."
1019,"Schner Spa area, pleasant service, elaborate Frhstcksbffet"
1020,"No lift in the stall, No towel change, no room cleaning etc. I can't give any information about the cleanliness of the rooms!"
1021,"Htel very well located in a quiet corner away from the hustle and bustle of central Venice, but only a few minutes by boat. The roofing economy rooms are not very ergonomic due to the slope of the roof and it is quickly hot if there is sun when the conditionn air does not yet work, as during the Pques congs. The extryt view is limited to the velux. TV is not a flat notch. We expect a little more luxury in a 4 canvases, but the prices are contained. The reception is irrproachable and the breakfast is very decent."
1022,It was a great stay for a short break. The wellness area is totally snoring. The restaurants are top - especially from the ambience. The Frhstck was the best fr a hotel so far (especially until 11:30 ) )
1023,"We went on a short break in Khlungsborn. The hotel makes a good impression. Negative was the lack of parking, a bare bartender on 30.08.2015 and a missing elevator to the third floor. The Baltic Sea was khl in Khlungsborn (17 C) and ... Two abortions were cancelled in the village. Why it was raining!!!"
1024,"We were accommodated in the side stall for 4 Nchte from 01.11.2015. Arriving in the room, we were immediately sent a message that we would have to undergo lrmbelstigungen (Baulrm) during our stay and that we were given a de-disapproval in the form of a bottle of red wine. Since we were travelling a lot during the day, the training was limited for us. Unfortunately, however, we found that the Bademntel (not even against Gebhr) was not available. We actually considered the use of high-quality corrugated treatments a bathrobe as self-evident...."
1025,"Great Frhstcksbuffet, friendly staff, snow spa area, Beach Nhe"
1026,"4 1/2 stars booked and received nothing dafr. We have been prescribed a habitual, filthy apartment. Adjoining house with a view of parking. No trace of idyll. Not of more than four stars. It all had the charm of a youth hostel of the nineties. Caution: no one who doesn't really like it should book the apartments. There is little cleaning before moving in and not at all during the stay. In the hallway there are brooms and luxurises toilet paper in the broom cupboard. One or two layer. For self-service. True luxury. Bathrobe and slippers are also in vain. That really demands too much. Just because the hotel is still four seasons at the broom cupboard and because you check in in the lobby of that hotel, and also very quickly out again, does not mean that the accommodation in the adjoining stall also has to flare up the fr 4 star laws. Even if the apartments bear Mozart and other sonic names, one should rather not expect anything, then one is not too much uncovered. Starting from the name Mozart: it must have been Mozart's last years, in the sloping, fashionable hole in a dark valley of Vienna."
1027,Excellent hotel in a beautiful location and good facilities.
1028,"Room a bit accustomed but still ok., service and frhstcksbuffet very good."
1029,A very relaxing long weekend in Khlungsborn. The hotel is located directly on the seafront promenade and the centre is just a few minutes away. The place offers a lot and looks very well maintained throughout. We will go there again.
1030,"very snow apartment in a quiet location fr small family with kitchen and extra children's room, so that self-catering is well possible the Frhstck was rich and always fresh with questions or snares was always reacted immediately by the staff - top"
1031,Very good Frhstcksbfett in a very pleasant atmosphere and attentive and friendly staff
1032,"VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WITH DIRECTIONS, KNOWING ALL THE RIGHT PLACES TO VISIT AND WHERE TO EAT TH BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. The Front Desk Receptionists were extremely helpful .. especially Sabrina who made us feel very welcomed to Lido.... We will be back next year for sure!"
1033,"Nice hotel with a large apartment and 2 balconies on the 2nd floor without elevator. Mngel: Cleanliness of the balconies (table with stains), frame of the balcony heavily soiled (red wine stains and lots of deck) shower curtain no cabin. An inappropriate scent in the bathroom that apparently comes from the lfter. heavily scratched wooden floor swimming pool is in the main house, which can only be reached via the street. Frhstck I have already been offered better in a 4**** house. Was ok, but not worth 18."
1034,"Very snowy house , nice attentive service , very good food including Frhstcksbffet , but balcony not usable , as the de-tling of the kche ends exactly at the balcony :-("
1035,"We stayed 4 days in the hotel and have felt very comfortable. We also found the location of the hotel very good, you are quickly on the beach and the shopping facilities are not far away."
1036,We've been very comfortable. Our room was clean and very nicely furnished. We were on the beach and then off to the sauna or the pool despite the not so snowy weather. It was very relaxing. Since we were there from Monday to Thursday it was not so crowded and that was very pleasant. There are enough shops and you can also just walk along the promenade.
1037,"We enjoyed the stay from 3rd to 8th May 2015 very much. The atmosphere in the hotel was very pleasant. Unfortunately, we only learned too spt that it was possible to get both a cupboard and a hot water heater, because these were the things we missed in a double room de Luxe. Our room was accessible by elevator as if you were looking for it and also had a balcony. Should we plan to stay at this hotel again, we would take a room to the east, depending on the season, as there is no air conditioning and it could get quite warm in the room in hot weather in The Sd or West."
1038,#NAME?
1039,"Heating in the belt and bedroom unfortunately insignificant or unusual. Message to reception within the first two hours of stay (Saturday afternoon). Answer that you can't do today. No apology or anything else. Second day then again at the reception (bath still ice cold). Offer that we can exchange the room, but no compensation for this shortage in a four-star hotel. New room: Heating warm, but in the evening a very trendy hum tone, which could not be precisely located (resonance from several reeds that flowed along the bedroom window). Complaint to reception was probably forgotten the moment I left the Tr. Service this time overall very uncovering. The number of previous visits were much better."
1040,"A very clean, well-run hotel with a snazzy wellness area. The apartments are unfortunately housed in a house about 50 m away, which could not be found on the booking page and make the stay less comfortable. Frhstck took place once in the apartment house and once in the main house. In the not so fast weather it is already unpleasant to take the way to the main house. The Wi-Fi is very slow and the elevator strists at a pace that comes close to a health risk. Otherwise, the apartments are furnished and furnished in a snody and functional way. View from the balcony in the rear part to the courtyard or the parking lot. From its location ideally located on the beach of Khlungsborn."
1041,On our Baltic Sea tour we were 4 Nchte with Frhstck in this hotel. We had a deluxe room - was very appealing with balcony and views slightly obscured to the Baltic Sea. Frhstck very good selection also with fish. Wellness department was also good. Not so big but enough. We would book this hotel again and can definitely recommend it. Also located right on the beach promenade and to the shopping mile also not far.
1042,Beach and promenade right in front of the Tr. We really enjoyed the 5 days. A special highlight was our suite. We had a lot of space for the children and could even sit in the garden in the beach basket.
1043,No shower but jets in the bathtub and my room was slanted but made it work
1044,last night for one day. Free room upgrade from standard double room to junior suite. Very nice reception at the reception . Very good room facilities with huge terrace. Direct location on the beach . Numerous restaurants in the hotel. Snow lovingly furnished bar on the ground floor. A great hotel .
1045,"We were pleased to have found a hotel that had a pleasant personal character. Very good service, friendly and competent communication, pleasant atmosphere. We are very happy to come back."
1046,"ACTUALLY WE ARE REALLY SATISFIED WITH THE HOTEL, WE HAVE A DE LUXE DOUBLE ROOM WITH FRHSTCK AND FREE Wi-Fi ACCESS FR 4 NCHTE BOOKED. LEIDER WAS THE W-LAN ( AFTER 12,00 EURO / DAY ) WHREND OUR STAY AND A SMALL DEVELOPMENT GAB ES DAFR ALSO NOT. :-("
1047,"We spent a week in Khlungsborn and were safe and well cared for. The hotel is ideally located between Khlungsborn-East and -West, but everything important (especially the beach) can be reached in about 1-5 minutes."
1048,"It was very nice, we are planning to go there again. The first view in the morning was to the sea. The staff was very nice and helpful. Rooms were very clean, you felt right there like at home."
1049,"Super tasty Frhstck, very large suite with two balconies, very good location to the center"
1050,"A short holiday on the Baltic Sea easy to relax, go for a walk and visit the nearby sts, enjoy wellness"
1051,"Very well located, quiet hotel with many amenities."
1052,"Hotel Vier Saisonen is located directly on the seafront promenade and the centre is within easy reach. The ambiance in this hotel ldt also in the next year to spend a holiday here. The rooms have a cosy décor. The Frhstck offers a varied offer for all ernhrungswnsche. The programme in the wellness area offers every holidaymaker an offer: the sporty swims and relaxes in the saunas: stone sauna or steam sauna, 60 degree sauna. The connoisseur takes advantage of the many massages and treatments. You can explore the region very well by bike. Heiligendamm is located in the immediate vicinity, but also Warnemnde can be reached quickly by bike. Overall, we had a sneaky stay."
1053,"It was a great stay, a nice room and a great spa area with a fantastic masseuse. Only the evening buffet at the Seaside lie to wnschen brig."
1054,"Friendly and quiet hotel on the Lido Island is a few minutes by vaporetto from Venice. Very friendly and speaking staff several languages, including French. A dying and unforgettable journey... no car l horyzon"
1055,"Four days of leave. The hotel is characterized by very friendly staff and attention to detail. The Frhstcksbuffett was a perfect start to the day every morning, we rented from the Hotel Fahrrder and took a tour to Warnemnde and zurck. In the restaurant Wolkenlos we spent a very leisurely evening and fed it with a nice meal, also the bar in the main house is worth a recommendation, not only for the bagpipe..."
1056,Great location and great ambience. The booked apartment was snooze.
1057,"Relaxing, high and very friendly staff. Also suitable for solo travellers."
1058,"The guest will find a very snowy hotel at an upscale level, which, however, has renovation needs and weak points in cleanliness. Otherwise it is worth a stay, even because of the kche in the orangery..."
1059,The hotel is very central is quite fast to Fu am Wasser or to the various localitte A Great Tip is the Baltic Sea Brewery and the marina
1060,"Reception and room very pleasant friendly and courteous staff, very good frhstck. A stay in the Wellne area is recommended. Well-trained staff ."
1061,"We spent a week on holiday at the Hotel Four-Seasons in Khlungsborn. The staff at the reception were prepared for our arrival. The necessary documents were available. Documents about Khlungsborn were submitted to us without request. We liked the room in the category de-luxe. Also a wish communicated by us in advance by e-mail was already in the room. The room is very rounded and well-appointed. On Friday evening we were invited together with the other newly arrived Guests to a champagne reception. The director and two senior staff members gave us information about the hotel, the hotel's restaurants and Khlungsborn. The Frhstck was just pointed. We were happy to use the hotel's own swimming pool. Furthermore, we used massages in the hotel's wellness area and found them to be very pleasant. The hotel's restaurants have been very popular with the ambience. We were very comfortable in the hotel and would like to come back. We recommend the hotel to continue."
1062,We liked the nhe to the beach and the center. The wellness area is also excellent.
1063,"The Deluxe double room is what it promises. All very stylishly furnished. We've been feeling good. Very grotesque. Also the bathroom is very large, even with double sink."
1064,Room 149 is located next to an air duct of air conditioning that was very noisy all day long. The room was just sucked not even wiped. In the morning there were too few staff for the catering in the Frstcksraum.
1065,"Really enjoyed the stay, about a 10min walk to the main waterbus station. Had the perfect quiet location and staff were really friendly!!"
1066,"as a family we received an upgrade despite only one night, Frhstck sensational"
1067,"The 4-year period is a beachfront but quietly located hotel. The hotel, despite its Gre, has a rather family character and is therefore very pleasant. The wellness and spa area, located in the basement, offers plenty of facilities to relax and get something good."
1068,I have written about The Point previously but wanted to validate another fantastic time here. We celebrated our 20th anniversary at The Point this past week. GM Cameron Karger and team outdid themselves again and again and again. We will be back again and again and again.
1069,"An experience for life. Just do it! Staff did their utmost to make our stay perfect, and perfect it was. Location is absolutely beautiful and secluded. Rooms and entire estate is very charming. Especially enjoyed taking the boats out on the lake. Hope to return some time in the future."
1070,"We were picked up from the airport in a car which was not vacuum cleaned for a long time. That might sound like a small thing, but it is symbolic for the rest of our experience. Just not good enough anymore, except the bill. Running a place like this is like being married to a Harvard educated supermodel. It's high... More"
1071,"On the shore of Lake Saranac, this is a very luxurious and peaceful place to stay. The food was high quality, and the service was perfect. Nothing is too much trouble. Lunch can be wherever you want it - a picnic on a small island, on the deck, in your room..... Breakfast is when and where you want it. Black... More"
1072,"From the minute you arrive until the minute you sadly have to leave The Point, you are treated as if your person needs and desires are the only thing that matter. The staff and service here are incomparable to most any place else you will ever stay. The setting is glorious, with great views of the lake and woods, and... More"
1073,"My review is long overdue but I tell so many people about this place that I felt I should add it to TripAdvisor. We visited The Point in October 2014 - and it was simply amazing - every single aspect of the visit was pure perfection! I am an Adirondack resident and absolutely loved the dcor, the setting, the boats,... More"
1074,"The point is possibly one of our favorite restaurants . With our children all over the age of 21 it's fun to go Out and enjoy a great meal snd casual drinks eith our children. I have never have been dissspinted with any thing I have ordered there to eat, and the orange crushes are amazing ."
1075,The Point exceeds perfection. From the moment you arrive be prepared to indulge. The grounds and accommodations are very charming and comfy. Besides all the dead animals on the walls. I'm a city girl and that took me a bit to get used to and settle into this mountainous element. It's a 5 star sleep away camp for adults. The... More
1076,Newly renovated bathroom raised the experience.
1077,"After having stayed at The Point for five days back in June of 2011, my wife and I elected to re-visit this wonderful Slice of Heaven on Earth, this time for two weeks for the Autumn colors. Wed just hosted our daughters wedding two weeks prior, and I felt that an indulgent get-away was just what the Mother of the... More"
1078,That is the name on one of their boats. And the essence of their philosophy. They have gotten the point and do everything right. From the warmest and crunchiest breakfast croissant to a lit fireplace and hot tea in the cabin to greet you after your hike. And every single person will do their outmost to keep you happy. Oh how... More
1079,I was lucky enough to spend 2 nights at The Point last year in February after dreaming about this place for quite some time.

1081,"The only place i'll stay in Houston. Fantastic service, incredibly friendly staff, great food and the best fitness options in the entire city. The rooms are a bit small and bathrooms are not luxurious by today's standards, but they are more than adequate and everything else about the place more than makes up for any shortcomings in that department."
1082,The room smelled as soon as you walked in. Smelled very humid.
1083,Loved everything about the Houstoinan from the very attentive car valets to the door greeter. My only complaint concerns the bed pillows. Unfortunately they were very thin flimsy! Loved the pool area gym too!
1084,wonderful acomadation !
1085,"Stayed one night to attend a meeting held the next day. Dined at in-house restaurant, The Olivette, where the wine list and the meal were excellent and the service was very good. The attractively decorated rooms are very quiet with a forest view out the windows. It is hard to imagine you are in the middle of a major city here. The room was very clean and there was nice turndown service. The room was adequately lighted and there were outlets to charge electronics. There were nice pillows on the bed and the linens were crisp and new-looking. Check in and Check Out were a breeze. The front desk verified my expenses and gave me a print out of my charges."
1086,Really enjoyed the spa. Great facial!
