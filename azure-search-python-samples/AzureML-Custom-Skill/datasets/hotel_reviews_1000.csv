Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.","Dungeons, Drain Flies and Centipedes",,A Traveler,

The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.",Excellent hotel with good access to Venice,,Simon,

Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen. Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt, dass unser Koffer nun da sei. Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle.

I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere.

The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy.

Wahrer Luxus eben. Bademantel und Slippers sucht man auch vergebens. Das wre auch wirklich zu viel verlangt. Nur weil am Besenschrank noch das Hotel vier Jahreszeiten grt und weil man in der Lobby eben jenes Hotels eincheckt, und auch ganz schnell wieder aus, heit das ja nicht, dass die Unterkunft im Nebengebude auch die fr 4 Sterne gesetzen Standards erfllen muss.

Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it.

There were a few hiccups in our stay, but we had such a nice time that the things that did go wrong are forgiven. The staff did try their best to makeup for the mishaps, which shows that they do care about their guests. I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest.

If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities.

The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room.

I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room.

With only 3 people at the bar and 2 in restaurant it shouldn't have taken 35 minutes to get an order of nachos, then when it came out, the order was wrong!! Waited another 30 mins for the main dish.

The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experienced.No security at the hotel, as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter. Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel.

We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!! In this day and age, smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable!!

I'm in grad school so I needed cheap. Considering the price, the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected. The staff was friendly enough, the hotel smelled like mildew, serious updates were needed, and the continental breakfast was lacking. The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself. The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The pillows were hard and lumpy...like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didn't really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did. The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off, a noise would start (I'm assuming some kind of duct work) that sounded like someone was knocking at my door.

So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed.

It was still just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in Branson. The breakfast included waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy as well as cold cereals and oatmeal. The property is on a steep hill, so park closer to the street and use the stairs closer to the front so you'll have fewer flights of stairs to climb.

FYI, the outdoor pool is open until 11 p.m. poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls, but if you have toddlers/young children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party, you may want to request a room on another side of the hotel--pool party noise kept us up late the first night (and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we weren't worn out from traveling!) Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!)

I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround. Closer to town, it has a few stores within walking distance.",Better Choices,,Richard,

The room was bigger than we anticipated. Which was nice. Front desk staff was friendly. Only negative was the road construction going on overnight. It was loud at times. Wish we slept on the other side of the hotel. But that's temporary. When finished we will stay there again.,"Nice hotel, staff, and a large room.",,A Traveler,

An added touch was the fresh popcorn made each afternoon. It was a welcome surprise. Another feature that adds to my stay is the inclusion of breakfast and a fresh cup of coffee. My only complaint is that sound was easily heard between rooms. It seems many hotels have this problem. Other than that I have a very pleasant stay.,Very comfortable hotel close to my future home.,,Diana,

The hotel's card reader was broken so no key was given out. They simply wrote down your room number and you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time. So anyone could have gotten in my room at any time. Plus the staff expressed how annoyed they were by having to do this. I felt as if I could never leave my room. Was not offered a discount or an apology. Will never go back.,Horrible,,Jennifer,
